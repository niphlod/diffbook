It also covers examples of Python modules that are used throughout the book.

While reading this chapter, you may need to refer to Chapter 2 for general Python syntax and to the following chapters for a more detailed reference about the functions that are used.</div><div class=""> - [[Chapter 4 ../04]] covers more systematically the core structure and libraries: URL mapping, request, response, sessions, caching, scheduler, cron, internationalization and general workflow.</div><div class=""> - [[Chapter 5 ../05]] is a reference for the template language used to build views. It shows how to embed Python code into HTML, and demonstrates the use of helpers (objects that can generate HTML).</div><div class=""> - [[Chapter 6 ../06]] covers the Database Abstraction Layer, or DAL. The syntax of the DAL is presented through a series of examples.</div><div class=""> - [[Chapter 7 ../07]] covers forms, form validation and form processing.

In the third edition of the book we have added extensive coverage of integration with third-party authentication mechanisms such as OpenID, OAuth, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</div><div class=""> - [[Chapter 10 ../10]] is about creating web services in web2py.

In this chapter, we discuss how to effectively use jQuery with web2py.</div><div class=""> - [[Chapter 12 ../12]] discusses web2py components and plugins as a way to build modular applications. We provide an example of a plugin that implements many commonly used functionality, such as charting, comments, and tagging.</div><div class="insert">- [[Chapter 13 ../13]] is about production deployment of web2py applications. We specifically discuss the deployment on a LAMP web server (which we consider the main deployment alternative).

It assumes knowledge of both procedural and object-oriented programming concepts such as loops, conditions, function calls and classes, and covers basic Python syntax. It also covers examples of Python modules that are used throughout the book. If you already know Python, you may skip Chapter 2.</div><div class="insert">+- [[Chapter 3 ../03]] shows how to start web2py, discusses the administrative interface, and guides the reader through various examples of increasing complexity: an application that returns a string, a counter application, an image blog, and a full blown wiki application that allows image uploads and comments, provides authentication, authorization, web services and an RSS feed. While reading this chapter, you may need to refer to Chapter 2 for general Python syntax and to the following chapters for a more detailed reference about the functions that are used.</div><div class="insert">+- [[Chapter 4 ../04]] covers more systematically the core structure and libraries: URL mapping, request, response, sessions, caching, scheduler, cron, internationalization and general workflow.</div><div class="insert">+- [[Chapter 5 ../05]] is a reference for the template language used to build views. It shows how to embed Python code into HTML, and demonstrates the use of helpers (objects that can generate HTML).</div><div class="insert">+- [[Chapter 6 ../06]] covers the Database Abstraction Layer, or DAL. The syntax of the DAL is presented through a series of examples.</div><div class="insert">+- [[Chapter 7 ../07]] covers forms, form validation and form processing. FORM is the low level helper for form building. SQLFORM is the high level form builder.

    <div class="span6"><div class="diff"><div class=""> In the diagram:</div><div class=""> - The Server can be the web2py built-in web server or a third-party server, such as Apache. The Server handles multi-threading.</div><div class=""> - &quot;main&quot; is the main WSGI application. It performs all common tasks and wraps user applications. It deals with cookies, sessions, transactions, URL routing and reverse routing, and dispatching.</div><div class="insert">It can serve and stream static files if the web server is not doing it <span class="highlight">y</span>e<span class="highlight">t</span>.</div><div class=""> - The Models, Views and Controller components make up the user application.</div><div class=""> - Multiple applications can be hosted in the same web2py instance.</div><div class=""> - The dashed arrows represent communication with the database engine(s). The database queries can be written in raw SQL (discouraged) or by using the web2py Database Abstraction Layer (recommended), so that web2py application code is not dependent on the specific database engine.</div><div class=""> - The dispatcher maps the requested URL to a function call in the controller. The output of the function can be a string or a dictionary of symbols (a hash table). The data in the dictionary is rendered by a view. If the visitor requests an HTML page (the default), the dictionary is rendered into an HTML page. If the visitor requests the same page in XML, web2py tries to find a view that can render the dictionary in XML. The developer can create views to render pages in any of the already supported protocols (HTML, XML, JSON, RSS, CSV, and RTF) or in additional custom protocols.</div><div class=""> - All calls are wrapped into a transaction, and any uncaught exception causes the transaction to be rolled back. If the request succeeds, the transaction is committed.</div><div class=""> - web2py also handles sessions and session cookies automatically, and when a transaction is committed, the session is also stored, unless specified otherwise.</div><div class=""> - It is possible to register recurrent tasks (via cron) to run at scheduled times and/or after the completion of certain actions. In this way it is possible to run long and compute-intensive tasks in the background without slowing down navigation.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> Here is a minimal and complete MVC application, consisting of three files:</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> **&quot;db.py&quot; is the model:**</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ``</div><div class=""> db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)</div><div class=""> db.define_table(&#x27;contact&#x27;,</div><div class="">    Field(&#x27;name&#x27;),</div><div class="">    Field(&#x27;phone&#x27;))</div><div class=""> ``:code</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> It connects to the database (in this example a SQLite database stored in the ``storage.sqlite`` file) and</div><div class=""> and returns the grid to the view.</div><div class=""> This view is called automatically by web2py after the associated controller function (action) is executed.</div><div class=""> The purpose of this view is to render the variables in the returned dictionary (in our case ``grid``) into HTML.</div><div class=""> The view file is written in HTML, but it embeds Python code delimited by the special ``{{`` and ``}}``</div><div class=""> delimiters. This is quite different from the PHP code example, because the only code</div><div class=""> embedded into the HTML is &quot;presentation layer&quot; code. The &quot;layout.html&quot; file referenced at the top of the</div><div class=""> view is provided by web2py and constitutes the basic layout for all web2py applications. The layout file can</div><div class=""> easily be modified or replaced.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### Why web2py</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> web2py is one of many web application frameworks, but it has compelling and unique features.</div><div class=""> web2py was originally developed as a teaching tool, with the following primary motivations:</div><div class=""> - Easy for users to learn server-side web development without compromising functionality. For this reason, web2py requires no installation and no configuration, has no dependencies (except for the source code distribution, which requires Python 2.5 and its standard library modules), and exposes most of its functionality via a Web interface, including an Integrated Development Environment with Debugger and database interface.</div><div class=""> - web2py has been stable from day one because it follows a top-down design; i.e., its API was designed before it was implemented. Even as new functionality has been added, web2py has never broken backwards compatibility, and it will not break compatibility when additional functionality is added in the future.</div><div class=""> - web2py proactively addresses the most important security issues which plague many modern web applications, as determined by OWASP``owasp``:cite  below.</div><div class=""> - web2py is lightweight. Its core libraries, including the Database Abstraction Layer, the template language, and all the helpers amount to 1.4MB. The entire source code including sample applications and images amounts to 10.4MB.</div><div class=""> - web2py has a small footprint and is very fast. It uses the Rocket``rocket``:cite  WSGI web server developed by Timothy Farrell. It is as fast as Apache with mod_wsgi, and supports SSL and IPv6.</div><div class=""> - web2py uses Python syntax for models, controllers, and views, but does not import models and controllers (as all the other Python frameworks do) - instead it executes them. This means that apps can be installed, uninstalled, and modified without having to restart the web server (even in production), and different apps can coexist without their modules interfering with one another.</div><div class=""> - web2py uses a Database Abstraction Layer (DAL) instead of an Object Relational Mapper (ORM). From a conceptual point of view, this means that different database tables are mapped into different instances of one ``Table`` class and not into different classes, while records are mapped into instances of one ``Row`` class, not into instances of the corresponding table class. From a practical point of view, it means that SQL syntax maps almost one-to-one into DAL syntax, and there is no complex metaclass programming going on under the hood as in popular ORMs, which would add latency.</div><div class=""> </div><div class="insert">WSGI ``wsgi-w``:cite ``wsgi-o``:cite (Web Server Gateway Interface) is an emerging Python standard for communication between a web server and Python applications<span class="highlight"></span>.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> Here is a screenshot of the main web2py **admin** interface:</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> [[image @///image/en200.png center 480px]]</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### Security</div><div class=""> ``security``:inxx</div><div class=""> The Open Web Application Security Project``owasp``:cite  (OWASP) is a free and open worldwide community focused</div><div class=""> on improving the security of application software.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> OWASP has listed the top ten security issues that put web applications at risk.</div><div class=""> That list is reproduced here, along with a description of how each issue is addressed by web2py:</div><div class=""> - ``cross site scripting``:inxx  &quot;Cross Site Scripting (XSS): XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes user supplied data and sends it to a web browser without first validating or encoding that content. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim&#x27;s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, possibly introduce worms, etc.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py, by default, escapes all variables rendered in the view, preventing XSS.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``injection flaws``:inxx &quot;Injection Flaws: Injection flaws, particularly SQL injection, are common in web applications. Injection occurs when user-supplied data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker&#x27;s hostile data tricks the interpreter into executing unintended commands or changing data.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes a Database Abstraction Layer that makes SQL injection impossible. Normally, SQL statements are not written by the developer.  Instead, SQL is generated dynamically by the DAL, ensuring that all inserted data is properly escaped.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``malicious file execution``:inxx &quot;Malicious File Execution: Code vulnerable to remote file inclusion (RFI) allows attackers to include hostile code and data, resulting in devastating attacks, such as total server compromise.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py allows only exposed functions to be executed, preventing malicious file execution. Imported functions are never exposed; only actions are exposed. web2py uses a Web-based administration interface which makes it very easy to keep track of what is exposed and what is not.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``insecure object reference``:inxx &quot;Insecure Direct Object Reference: A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, database record, or key, as a URL or form parameter. Attackers can manipulate those references to access other objects without authorization.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py does not expose any internal objects; moreover, web2py validates all URLs, thus preventing directory traversal attacks. web2py also provides a simple mechanism to create forms that automatically validate all input values.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``CSRF``:inxx &quot;Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF): A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim&#x27;s browser to send a pre-authenticated request to a vulnerable web application, which then forces the victim&#x27;s browser to perform a hostile action to the benefit of the attacker. CSRF can be as powerful as the web application that it attacks.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py prevents CSRF as well as accidental double submission of forms by assigning a one-time random token to each form. Moreover web2py uses UUID for session cookie.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``information leakage``:inxx ``improper error handling``:inxx &quot;Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling: Applications can unintentionally leak information about their configuration, internal workings, or violate privacy through a variety of application problems. Attackers use this weakness to steal sensitive data, or conduct more serious attacks.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes a ticketing system. No error can result in code being exposed to the users. All errors are logged and a ticket is issued to the user that allows error tracking. But errors and source code are accessible only to the administrator.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - &quot;Broken Authentication and Session Management: Account credentials and session tokens are often not properly protected. Attackers compromise passwords, keys, or authentication tokens to assume other users&#x27; identities.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py provides a built-in mechanism for administrator authentication, and it manages sessions independently for each application. The administrative interface also forces the use of secure session cookies when the client is not &quot;localhost&quot;. For applications, it includes a powerful Role Based Access Control API.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> Igor Gassko,</div><div class=""> Ismael Serratos,</div><div class=""> Jan Beilicke,</div><div class=""> Jay Kelkar,</div><div class=""> Jeff Bauer,</div><div class=""> Jesus Matrinez,</div><div class=""> Jim Karsten,</div><div class=""> Joachim Breitsprecher,</div><div class=""> Joakim Eriksson,</div><div class=""> Joe Barnhart,</div><div class=""> Joel Carrier,</div><div class=""> Joel Samuelsson,</div><div class=""> John Heenan,</div><div class=""> Jon Romero,</div><div class=""> Jonas Rundberg,</div><div class=""> Jonathan Benn,</div><div class=""> Jonathan Lundell,</div><div class=""> Jose Jachuf,</div><div class=""> Joseph Piron,</div><div class=""> Josh Goldfoot,</div><div class=""> Josh Jaques,</div><div class="insert">Jos<span class="highlight">e</span> Vicente de Sousa,</div><div class=""> Jurgis Pralgauskis,</div><div class=""> Keith Yang,</div><div class=""> Kenji Hosoda,</div><div class=""> Kenneth Lundstr,</div><div class=""> Kirill Spitsin,</div><div class=""> Kyle Smith,</div><div class=""> Larry Weinberg,</div><div class=""> Limodou,</div><div class=""> Loren McGinnis,</div><div class=""> Louis DaPrato,</div><div class=""> Luca De Alfaro,</div><div class=""> Luca Zachetti,</div><div class="insert">Lucas D&#x27;<span class="highlight">A</span>vila,</div></div></div>

If the request succeeds, the transaction is committed.</div><div class=""> - web2py also handles sessions and session cookies automatically, and when a transaction is committed, the session is also stored, unless specified otherwise.</div><div class=""> - It is possible to register recurrent tasks (via cron) to run at scheduled times and/or after the completion of certain actions. In this way it is possible to run long and compute-intensive tasks in the background without slowing down navigation.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> Here is a minimal and complete MVC application, consisting of three files:</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> **&quot;db.py&quot; is the model:**</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ``</div><div class=""> db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)</div><div class=""> db.define_table(&#x27;contact&#x27;,</div><div class="">    Field(&#x27;name&#x27;),</div><div class="">    Field(&#x27;phone&#x27;))</div><div class=""> ``:code</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> It connects to the database (in this example a SQLite database stored in the ``storage.sqlite`` file) and</div><div class=""> and returns the grid to the view.</div><div class=""> This view is called automatically by web2py after the associated controller function (action) is executed.</div><div class=""> The purpose of this view is to render the variables in the returned dictionary (in our case ``grid``) into HTML.</div><div class=""> The view file is written in HTML, but it embeds Python code delimited by the special ``{{`` and ``}}``</div><div class=""> delimiters. This is quite different from the PHP code example, because the only code</div><div class=""> embedded into the HTML is &quot;presentation layer&quot; code. The &quot;layout.html&quot; file referenced at the top of the</div><div class=""> view is provided by web2py and constitutes the basic layout for all web2py applications. The layout file can</div><div class=""> easily be modified or replaced.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### Why web2py</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> web2py is one of many web application frameworks, but it has compelling and unique features.</div><div class=""> web2py was originally developed as a teaching tool, with the following primary motivations:</div><div class=""> - Easy for users to learn server-side web development without compromising functionality. For this reason, web2py requires no installation and no configuration, has no dependencies (except for the source code distribution, which requires Python 2.5 and its standard library modules), and exposes most of its functionality via a Web interface, including an Integrated Development Environment with Debugger and database interface.</div><div class=""> - web2py has been stable from day one because it follows a top-down design; i.e., its API was designed before it was implemented. Even as new functionality has been added, web2py has never broken backwards compatibility, and it will not break compatibility when additional functionality is added in the future.</div><div class=""> - web2py proactively addresses the most important security issues which plague many modern web applications, as determined by OWASP``owasp``:cite  below.</div><div class=""> - web2py is lightweight. Its core libraries, including the Database Abstraction Layer, the template language, and all the helpers amount to 1.4MB. The entire source code including sample applications and images amounts to 10.4MB.</div><div class=""> - web2py has a small footprint and is very fast. It uses the Rocket``rocket``:cite  WSGI web server developed by Timothy Farrell. It is as fast as Apache with mod_wsgi, and supports SSL and IPv6.</div><div class=""> - web2py uses Python syntax for models, controllers, and views, but does not import models and controllers (as all the other Python frameworks do) - instead it executes them. This means that apps can be installed, uninstalled, and modified without having to restart the web server (even in production), and different apps can coexist without their modules interfering with one another.</div><div class=""> - web2py uses a Database Abstraction Layer (DAL) instead of an Object Relational Mapper (ORM). From a conceptual point of view, this means that different database tables are mapped into different instances of one ``Table`` class and not into different classes, while records are mapped into instances of one ``Row`` class, not into instances of the corresponding table class. From a practical point of view, it means that SQL syntax maps almost one-to-one into DAL syntax, and there is no complex metaclass programming going on under the hood as in popular ORMs, which would add latency.</div><div class=""> </div><div class="delete">WSGI ``wsgi-w``:cite ``wsgi-o``:cite (Web Server Gateway Interface) is an emerging Python standard for communication between a web server and Python applications<span class="highlight">)</span>.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> Here is a screenshot of the main web2py **admin** interface:</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> [[image @///image/en200.png center 480px]]</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### Security</div><div class=""> ``security``:inxx</div><div class=""> The Open Web Application Security Project``owasp``:cite  (OWASP) is a free and open worldwide community focused</div><div class=""> on improving the security of application software.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> OWASP has listed the top ten security issues that put web applications at risk.</div><div class=""> That list is reproduced here, along with a description of how each issue is addressed by web2py:</div><div class=""> - ``cross site scripting``:inxx  &quot;Cross Site Scripting (XSS): XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes user supplied data and sends it to a web browser without first validating or encoding that content. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim&#x27;s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, possibly introduce worms, etc.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py, by default, escapes all variables rendered in the view, preventing XSS.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``injection flaws``:inxx &quot;Injection Flaws: Injection flaws, particularly SQL injection, are common in web applications. Injection occurs when user-supplied data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker&#x27;s hostile data tricks the interpreter into executing unintended commands or changing data.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes a Database Abstraction Layer that makes SQL injection impossible. Normally, SQL statements are not written by the developer.  Instead, SQL is generated dynamically by the DAL, ensuring that all inserted data is properly escaped.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``malicious file execution``:inxx &quot;Malicious File Execution: Code vulnerable to remote file inclusion (RFI) allows attackers to include hostile code and data, resulting in devastating attacks, such as total server compromise.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py allows only exposed functions to be executed, preventing malicious file execution. Imported functions are never exposed; only actions are exposed. web2py uses a Web-based administration interface which makes it very easy to keep track of what is exposed and what is not.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``insecure object reference``:inxx &quot;Insecure Direct Object Reference: A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, database record, or key, as a URL or form parameter. Attackers can manipulate those references to access other objects without authorization.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py does not expose any internal objects; moreover, web2py validates all URLs, thus preventing directory traversal attacks. web2py also provides a simple mechanism to create forms that automatically validate all input values.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``CSRF``:inxx &quot;Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF): A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim&#x27;s browser to send a pre-authenticated request to a vulnerable web application, which then forces the victim&#x27;s browser to perform a hostile action to the benefit of the attacker. CSRF can be as powerful as the web application that it attacks.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py prevents CSRF as well as accidental double submission of forms by assigning a one-time random token to each form. Moreover web2py uses UUID for session cookie.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``information leakage``:inxx ``improper error handling``:inxx &quot;Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling: Applications can unintentionally leak information about their configuration, internal workings, or violate privacy through a variety of application problems. Attackers use this weakness to steal sensitive data, or conduct more serious attacks.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes a ticketing system. No error can result in code being exposed to the users. All errors are logged and a ticket is issued to the user that allows error tracking. But errors and source code are accessible only to the administrator.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - &quot;Broken Authentication and Session Management: Account credentials and session tokens are often not properly protected. Attackers compromise passwords, keys, or authentication tokens to assume other users&#x27; identities.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py provides a built-in mechanism for administrator authentication, and it manages sessions independently for each application. The administrative interface also forces the use of secure session cookies when the client is not &quot;localhost&quot;. For applications, it includes a powerful Role Based Access Control API.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> Igor Gassko,</div><div class=""> Ismael Serratos,</div><div class=""> Jan Beilicke,</div><div class=""> Jay Kelkar,</div><div class=""> Jeff Bauer,</div><div class=""> Jesus Matrinez,</div><div class=""> Jim Karsten,</div><div class=""> Joachim Breitsprecher,</div><div class=""> Joakim Eriksson,</div><div class=""> Joe Barnhart,</div><div class=""> Joel Carrier,</div><div class=""> Joel Samuelsson,</div><div class=""> John Heenan,</div><div class=""> Jon Romero,</div><div class=""> Jonas Rundberg,</div><div class=""> Jonathan Benn,</div><div class=""> Jonathan Lundell,</div><div class=""> Jose Jachuf,</div><div class=""> Joseph Piron,</div><div class=""> Josh Goldfoot,</div><div class=""> Josh Jaques,</div><div class="delete">Jos<span class="highlight">é</span> Vicente de Sousa,</div><div class=""> Jurgis Pralgauskis,</div><div class=""> Keith Yang,</div><div class=""> Kenji Hosoda,</div><div class=""> Kenneth Lundstr,</div><div class=""> Kirill Spitsin,</div><div class=""> Kyle Smith,</div><div class=""> Larry Weinberg,</div><div class=""> Limodou,</div><div class=""> Loren McGinnis,</div><div class=""> Louis DaPrato,</div><div class=""> Luca De Alfaro,</div><div class=""> Luca Zachetti,</div><div class="delete">Lucas D&#x27;<span class="highlight">Á</span>vila,</div></div></div>

You will find</div><div class=""> that web2py does not always follow these rules. This is not because of omissions or negligence; it is our</div><div class=""> belief that the users of web2py should follow these rules and we encourage it. We chose not to</div><div class=""> follow some of those rules when defining web2py helper objects in order to minimize the probability</div><div class=""> of name conflict with objects defined by the user.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> For example, the class that represents a ``&lt;div&gt;`` is called ``DIV``, while according to the</div><div class=""> Python style reference it should have been called ``Div``. We believe that, for this specific example that</div><div class=""> using an all-upper-case &quot;DIV&quot; is a more natural choice. Moreover, this approach leaves programmers</div><div class=""> free to create a class called &quot;Div&quot; if they choose to do so.</div><div class=""> Our syntax also maps naturally into the DOM notation of most browsers (including, for example, Firefox).</div><div class=""> variables. Continuing with our example, even considering that ``DIV`` is a class</div><div class=""> it is a special class that should never be modified by</div><div class=""> the user because doing so would break other web2py applications.</div><div class=""> Hence, we believe this qualifies the ``DIV`` class as</div><div class=""> something that should be treated as a constant, further justifying our choice of notation.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> In summary, the following conventions are followed:</div><div class=""> - HTML helpers and validators are all upper case for the reasons discussed above (for example ``DIV``, ``A``, ``FORM``, ``URL``).</div><div class=""> - The translator object ``T`` is upper case despite the fact that it is an instance of a class and not a class itself.

It assumes knowledge of both procedural and object-oriented programming concepts such as loops, conditions, function calls and classes, and covers basic Python syntax. It also covers examples of Python modules that are used throughout the book. If you already know Python, you may skip Chapter 2.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 3 shows how to start web2py, discusses the administrative interface, and guides the reader through various examples of increasing complexity: an application that returns a string, a counter application, an image blog, and a full blown wiki application that allows image uploads and comments, provides authentication, authorization, web services and an RSS feed. While reading this chapter, you may need to refer to Chapter 2 for general Python syntax and to the following chapters for a more detailed reference about the functions that are used.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 4 covers more systematically the core structure and libraries: URL mapping, request, response, sessions, caching, schedulre, cron, internationalization and general workflow.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 5 is a reference for the template language used to build views. It shows how to embed Python code into HTML, and demonstrates the use of helpers (objects that can generate HTML).</div><div class=""> - Chapter 6 covers the Database Abstraction Layer, or DAL. The syntax of the DAL is presented through a series of examples.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 7 covers forms, form validation and form processing. FORM is the low level helper for form building. SQLFORM is the high level form builder. In Chapter 7 we also discuss Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) API.</div><div class="delete">- Chapter 8 covers communication <span class="highlight">wi</span>t<span class="highlight">h</span> as<span class="highlight"></span> sending emails and SMSes.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 9 covers authentication, authorization and the extensible Role-Based Access Control mechanism available in web2py. Mail configuration and CAPTCHA are also discussed here, since they are used for authentication. In the third edition of the book we have added extensive coverage of integration with third-party authentication mechanisms such as OpenID, OAuth, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 10 is about creating web services in web2py. We provide examples of integration with the Google Web Toolkit via Pyjamas, and with Adobe Flash via PyAMF.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 11 is about web2py and jQuery recipes. web2py is designed mainly for server-side programming, but it includes jQuery, since we have found it to be the best open-source JavaScript library available for effects and Ajax. In this chapter, we discuss how to effectively use jQuery with web2py.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 12 discusses web2py components and plugins as a way to build modular applications. We provide an example of a plugin that implements many commonly used functionality, such as charting, comments, and tagging.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 13 is about production deployment of web2py applications. We specifically discuss the deployment on a LAMP web server (which we consider the main deployment alternative). We discuss alterantive web servers, and configuration of the PostgreSQL database. We discuss running as a service on a Microsoft Windows environment, and deployment on some specific platforms including Google Applications Engine, Heorku, and PythonAnywhere. In this chapter, we also discuss security and scalability issues.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 14 contains a variety of other recipes to solve specific tasks, including upgrades, geocoding, pagination, the Twitter API, and more.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> This book only covers basic web2py functionalities and the API that ships with web2py.</div><div class=""> This book does not cover web2py appliances (i.e. ready made applications).</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> You can download web2py appliances from the corresponding web site ``appliances``:cite.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> You can find additional topics discussed on the usergroup``usergroup``:cite. There is also AlterEgo``alterego``:cite, the old web2py blog and FAQ.</div><div class=""> ``MARKMIN``:inxx</div><div class=""> This book has been written using the markmin syntax and automatically converted to HTML, LaTeX and PDF.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### Support</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> The main support channel is the usergroup``usergroup``:cite, with dozens of posts every day. Even if you&#x27;re a newbie, don&#x27;t hesitate to ask - we&#x27;ll be pleased to help you.  </div><div class="delete">There is also a formal issue tracker system on http://code.google.com/p/web2py/issue<span class="highlight"></span> . Last but not least, you can have professional support (see the web site for details). </div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### Contribute</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> Any help is really appreciated. You can help other users on the user group, or by directly submitting patches on the program (at the GitHub site https://github.com/web2py/web2py). </div><div class=""> Even if you find a typo on this book, or have an improvement on it, the best way to help is by patching the book itself (which is under the source folder of the repository </div><div class=""> at https://github.com/mdipierro/web2py-book).</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### Elements of style</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> PEP8 ``style``:cite  contains good style practices when programming with Python. You will find</div><div class=""> that web2py does not always follow these rules. This is not because of omissions or negligence; it is our</div><div class=""> belief that the users of web2py should follow these rules and we encourage it. We chose not to</div><div class=""> follow some of those rules when defining web2py helper objects in order to minimize the probability</div><div class=""> of name conflict with objects defined by the user.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> For example, the class that represents a ``&lt;div&gt;`` is called ``DIV``, while according to the</div><div class=""> Python style reference it should have been called ``Div``. We believe that, for this specific example that</div><div class=""> using an all-upper-case &quot;DIV&quot; is a more natural choice. Moreover, this approach leaves programmers</div><div class=""> free to create a class called &quot;Div&quot; if they choose to do so.</div><div class=""> Our syntax also maps naturally into the DOM notation of most browsers (including, for example, Firefox).</div><div class=""> variables. Continuing with our example, even considering that ``DIV`` is a class</div><div class=""> it is a special class that should never be modified by</div><div class=""> the user because doing so would break other web2py applications.</div><div class=""> Hence, we believe this qualifies the ``DIV`` class as</div><div class=""> something that should be treated as a constant, further justifying our choice of notation.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> In summary, the following conventions are followed:</div><div class=""> - HTML helpers and validators are all upper case for the reasons discussed above (for example ``DIV``, ``A``, ``FORM``, ``URL``).</div><div class=""> - The translator object ``T`` is upper case despite the fact that it is an instance of a class and not a class itself. Logically the translator object performs an action similar to the HTML helpers, it affects rendering part of the presentation. Also, ``T`` needs to be easy to locate in the code and must have a short name.</div><div class=""> - DAL classes follow the Python style guide (first letter capitalized), for example ``Table``, ``Field``, ``Query``, ``Row``, ``Rows``, etc.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> In all other cases we believe we have followed, as much as possible,</div><div class=""> the Python Style Guide (PEP8).</div><div class=""> For example all instance objects are lower-case (request, response, session, cache), and all internal classes are capitalized.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> In all the examples of this book, web2py keywords are shown in bold, while strings and comments are shown in italic.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### License</div><div class=""> ``license``:inxx</div><div class=""> </div><div class="delete">web2py is licensed under the LGPL version 3 License.

In particular, web2py does not import user applications, but executes them in a predefined context.  This context exposes the Python keywords, as well as the web2py keywords.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> To some this may appear as magic, but it should not.</div><div class=""> That list is reproduced here, along with a description of how each issue is addr</div><div class=""> web2py was reviewed for security and you can find the result of the review in ref.``pythonsecurity``:cite.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### In the box</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> You can download web2py from the official web site:</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ``</div><div class=""> http://www.web2py.com</div><div class=""> ``:code</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> web2py is composed of the following components:</div><div class=""> - **libraries**: provide core functionality of web2py and are accessible programmatically.</div><div class=""> - **web server**: the Rocket WSGI web server.</div><div class=""> - the **admin** application: used to create, design, and manage other web2py applications. **admin** provides a complete web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building web2py applications.

It assumes knowledge of both procedural and object-oriented programming concepts such as loops, conditions, function calls and classes, and covers basic Python syntax. It also covers examples of Python modules that are used throughout the book. If you already know Python, you may skip Chapter 2.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 3 shows how to start web2py, discusses the administrative interface, and guides the reader through various examples of increasing complexity: an application that returns a string, a counter application, an image blog, and a full blown wiki application that allows image uploads and comments, provides authentication, authorization, web services and an RSS feed. While reading this chapter, you may need to refer to Chapter 2 for general Python syntax and to the following chapters for a more detailed reference about the functions that are used.</div><div class="delete">- Chapter 4 covers more systematically the core structure and libraries: URL mapping, request, response, sessions, caching, <span class="highlight"></span>cron, internationalization and general workflow.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 5 is a reference for the template language used to build views. It shows how to embed Python code into HTML, and demonstrates the use of helpers (objects that can generate HTML).</div><div class=""> - Chapter 6 covers the Database Abstraction Layer, or DAL. The syntax of the DAL is presented through a series of examples.</div><div class="delete">- Chapter 7 covers forms, form validation and form processing. FORM is the low level helper for form building. SQLFORM is the high level form builder. In Chapter 7 we also discuss <span class="highlight">legacy </span>Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) API.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 8 covers communication with as sending emails and SMSes.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 9 covers authentication, authorization and the extensible Role-Based Access Control mechanism available in web2py. Mail configuration and CAPTCHA are also discussed here, since they are used for authentication. In the third edition of the book we have added extensive coverage of integration with third-party authentication mechanisms such as OpenID, OAuth, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 10 is about creating web services in web2py. We provide examples of integration with the Google Web Toolkit via Pyjamas, and with Adobe Flash via PyAMF.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 11 is about web2py and jQuery recipes. web2py is designed mainly for server-side programming, but it includes jQuery, since we have found it to be the best open-source JavaScript library available for effects and Ajax. In this chapter, we discuss how to effectively use jQuery with web2py.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 12 discusses web2py components and plugins as a way to build modular applications. We provide an example of a plugin that implements many commonly used functionality, such as charting, comments, tagging, and wiki.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 13 is about production deployment of web2py applications. We mainly address three possible production scenarios: on a Linux web server or a set of servers (which we consider the main deployment alternative), running as a service on a Microsoft Windows environment, and deployment on the Google Applications Engine. In this chapter, we also discuss security and scalability issues.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 14 contains a variety of other recipes to solve specific tasks, including upgrades, geocoding, pagination, the Twitter API, and more.</div></div></div>

You will find</div><div class="insert">+that web2py does not always follow these rules. This is not because of omissions or negligence; it is our</div><div class="insert">+belief that the users of web2py should follow these rules and we encourage it. We chose not to</div><div class="insert">+follow some of those rules when defining web2py helper objects in order to minimize the probability</div><div class="insert">+of name conflict with objects defined by the user.</div><div class="insert">+</div><div class="insert">+For example, the class that represents a ``&lt;div&gt;`` is called ``DIV``, while according to the</div><div class="insert">+Python style reference it should have been called ``Div``. We believe that, for this specific example that</div><div class="insert">+using an all-upper-case &quot;DIV&quot; is a more natural choice. Moreover, this approach leaves programmers</div><div class="insert">+free to create a class called &quot;Div&quot; if they choose to do so.</div><div class="insert">+Our syntax also maps naturally into the DOM notation of most browsers (including, for example, Firefox).</div><div class="insert">+</div><div class="insert">+According to the Python style guide, all-upper-case strings should be used for constants and not</div><div class="insert">+variables. Continuing with our example, even considering that ``DIV`` is a class,</div><div class="insert">+it is a special class that should never be modified by</div><div class="insert">+the user because doing so would break other web2py applications.</div><div class="insert">+Hence, we believe this qualifies the ``DIV`` class as</div><div class="insert">+something that should be treated as a constant, further justifying our choice of notation.</div><div class="insert">+</div><div class="insert">+In summary, the following conventions are followed:</div><div class="insert">+- HTML helpers and validators are all upper case for the reasons discussed above (for example ``DIV``, ``A``, ``FORM``, ``URL``).</div><div class="insert">+- The translator object ``T`` is upper case despite the fact that it is an instance of a class and not a class itself. Logically the translator object performs an action similar to the HTML helpers, it affects rendering part of the presentation. Also, ``T`` needs to be easy to locate in the code and must have a short name.</div><div class="insert">+- DAL classes follow the Python style guide (first letter capitalized), for example ``Table``, ``Field``, ``Query``, ``Row``, ``Rows``, etc.</div><div class="insert">+</div><div class="insert">+In all other cases we believe we have followed, as much as possible,</div><div class="insert">+the Python Style Guide (PEP8).</div><div class="insert">+For example all instance objects are lower-case (request, response, session, cache), and all internal classes are capitalized.</div><div class="insert">+</div><div class="insert">+In all the examples of this book, web2py keywords are shown in bold, while strings and comments are shown in italic.</div><div class="insert">+</div><div class="insert">+</div><div class=""> ### License</div><div class=""> ``license``:inxx</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> web2py is licensed under the LGPL version 3 License.

This book is dedicated to them.</div><div class=""> </div><div class="delete">-### About this book</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-This book includes the following chapters, besides this introduction:</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 2 is a minimalist introduction to Python. It assumes knowledge of both procedural and object-oriented programming concepts such as loops, conditions, function calls and classes, and covers basic Python syntax. It also covers examples of Python modules that are used throughout the book. If you already know Python, you may skip Chapter 2.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 3 shows how to start web2py, discusses the administrative interface, and guides the reader through various examples of increasing complexity: an application that returns a string, a counter application, an image blog, and a full blown wiki application that allows image uploads and comments, provides authentication, authorization, web services and an RSS feed. While reading this chapter, you may need to refer to Chapter 2 for general Python syntax and to the following chapters for a more detailed reference about the functions that are used.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 4 covers more systematically the core structure and libraries: URL mapping, request, response, sessions, caching, cron, internationalization and general workflow.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 5 is a reference for the template language used to build views. It shows how to embed Python code into HTML, and demonstrates the use of helpers (objects that can generate HTML).</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 6 covers the Database Abstraction Layer, or DAL. The syntax of the DAL is presented through a series of examples.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 7 covers forms, form validation and form processing. FORM is the low level helper for form building. SQLFORM is the high level form builder. In Chapter 7 we also discuss legacy Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) API.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 8 covers communication with as sending emails and SMSes.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 9 covers authentication, authorization and the extensible Role-Based Access Control mechanism available in web2py. Mail configuration and CAPTCHA are also discussed here, since they are used for authentication. In the third edition of the book we have added extensive coverage of integration with third-party authentication mechanisms such as OpenID, OAuth, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 10 is about creating web services in web2py. We provide examples of integration with the Google Web Toolkit via Pyjamas, and with Adobe Flash via PyAMF.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 11 is about web2py and jQuery recipes. web2py is designed mainly for server-side programming, but it includes jQuery, since we have found it to be the best open-source JavaScript library available for effects and Ajax. In this chapter, we discuss how to effectively use jQuery with web2py.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 12 discusses web2py components and plugins as a way to build modular applications. We provide an example of a plugin that implements many commonly used functionality, such as charting, comments, tagging, and wiki.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 13 is about production deployment of web2py applications. We mainly address three possible production scenarios: on a Linux web server or a set of servers (which we consider the main deployment alternative), running as a service on a Microsoft Windows environment, and deployment on the Google Applications Engine. In this chapter, we also discuss security and scalability issues.</div><div class="delete">-- Chapter 14 contains a variety of other recipes to solve specific tasks, including upgrades, geocoding, pagination, the Twitter API, and more.</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-This book only covers basic web2py functionalities and the API that ships with web2py.</div><div class="delete">-This book does not cover web2py appliances (i.e. ready made applications).</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-You can download web2py appliances from the corresponding web site ``appliances``:cite.</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-You can find additional topics discussed on the usergroup``usergroup``:cite. There is also AlterEgo``alterego``:cite, the old web2py blog and FAQ.</div><div class="delete">-``MARKMIN``:inxx</div><div class="delete">-This book has been written using the markmin syntax and automatically converted to HTML, LaTeX and PDF.</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-### Support</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-The main support channel is the usergroup``usergroup``:cite, with dozens of posts every day. Even if you&#x27;re a newbie, don&#x27;t hesitate to ask - we&#x27;ll be pleased to help you.  </div><div class="delete">-There is also a formal issue tracker system on http://code.google.com/p/web2py/issue . Last but not least, you can have professional support (see the web site for details). </div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-### Contribute</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-Any help is really appreciated. You can help other users on the user group, or by directly submitting patches on the program (at the GitHub site https://github.com/web2py/web2py). </div><div class="delete">-Even if you find a typo on this book, or have an improvement on it, the best way to help is by patching the book itself (which is under the source folder of the repository </div><div class="delete">-at https://github.com/mdipierro/web2py-book).</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-### Elements of style</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-PEP8 ``style``:cite  contains good style practices when programming with Python. You will find</div><div class="delete">-that web2py does not always follow these rules. This is not because of omissions or negligence; it is our</div><div class="delete">-belief that the users of web2py should follow these rules and we encourage it. We chose not to</div><div class="delete">-follow some of those rules when defining web2py helper objects in order to minimize the probability</div><div class="delete">-of name conflict with objects defined by the user.</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-For example, the class that represents a ``&lt;div&gt;`` is called ``DIV``, while according to the</div><div class="delete">-Python style reference it should have been called ``Div``. We believe that, for this specific example that</div><div class="delete">-using an all-upper-case &quot;DIV&quot; is a more natural choice. Moreover, this approach leaves programmers</div><div class="delete">-free to create a class called &quot;Div&quot; if they choose to do so.</div><div class="delete">-Our syntax also maps naturally into the DOM notation of most browsers (including, for example, Firefox).</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-According to the Python style guide, all-upper-case strings should be used for constants and not</div><div class="delete">-variables. Continuing with our example, even considering that ``DIV`` is a class,</div><div class="delete">-it is a special class that should never be modified by</div><div class="delete">-the user because doing so would break other web2py applications.</div><div class="delete">-Hence, we believe this qualifies the ``DIV`` class as</div><div class="delete">-something that should be treated as a constant, further justifying our choice of notation.</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-In summary, the following conventions are followed:</div><div class="delete">-- HTML helpers and validators are all upper case for the reasons discussed above (for example ``DIV``, ``A``, ``FORM``, ``URL``).</div><div class="delete">-- The translator object ``T`` is upper case despite the fact that it is an instance of a class and not a class itself. Logically the translator object performs an action similar to the HTML helpers, it affects rendering part of the presentation. Also, ``T`` needs to be easy to locate in the code and must have a short name.</div><div class="delete">-- DAL classes follow the Python style guide (first letter capitalized), for example ``Table``, ``Field``, ``Query``, ``Row``, ``Rows``, etc.</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-In all other cases we believe we have followed, as much as possible,</div><div class="delete">-the Python Style Guide (PEP8).</div><div class="delete">-For example all instance objects are lower-case (request, response, session, cache), and all internal classes are capitalized.</div><div class="delete">-</div><div class="delete">-In all the examples of this book, web2py keywords are shown in bold, while strings and comments are shown in italic.</div></div></div>

XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim&#x27;s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, possibly introduce worms, etc.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py, by default, escapes all variables rendered in the view, preventing XSS.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``injection flaws``:inxx &quot;Injection Flaws: Injection flaws, particularly SQL injection, are common in web applications. Injection occurs when user-supplied data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker&#x27;s hostile data tricks the interpreter into executing unintended commands or changing data.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes a Database Abstraction Layer that makes SQL injection impossible. Normally, SQL statements are not written by the developer.  Instead, SQL is generated dynamically by the DAL, ensuring that all inserted data is properly escaped.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``malicious file execution``:inxx &quot;Malicious File Execution: Code vulnerable to remote file inclusion (RFI) allows attackers to include hostile code and data, resulting in devastating attacks, such as total server compromise.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py allows only exposed functions to be executed, preventing malicious file execution. Imported functions are never exposed; only actions are exposed. web2py uses a Web-based administration interface which makes it very easy to keep track of what is exposed and what is not.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``insecure object reference``:inxx &quot;Insecure Direct Object Reference: A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, database record, or key, as a URL or form parameter. Attackers can manipulate those references to access other objects without authorization.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py does not expose any internal objects; moreover, web2py validates all URLs, thus preventing directory traversal attacks. web2py also provides a simple mechanism to create forms that automatically validate all input values.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``CSRF``:inxx &quot;Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF): A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim&#x27;s browser to send a pre-authenticated request to a vulnerable web application, which then forces the victim&#x27;s browser to perform a hostile action to the benefit of the attacker. CSRF can be as powerful as the web application that it attacks.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py prevents CSRF as well as accidental double submission of forms by assigning a one-time random token to each form. Moreover web2py uses UUID for session cookie.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``information leakage``:inxx ``improper error handling``:inxx &quot;Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling: Applications can unintentionally leak information about their configuration, internal workings, or violate privacy through a variety of application problems. Attackers use this weakness to steal sensitive data, or conduct more serious attacks.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes a ticketing system. No error can result in code being exposed to the users. All errors are logged and a ticket is issued to the user that allows error tracking. But errors and source code are accessible only to the administrator.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - &quot;Broken Authentication and Session Management: Account credentials and session tokens are often not properly protected. Attackers compromise passwords, keys, or authentication tokens to assume other users&#x27; identities.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py provides a built-in mechanism for administrator authentication, and it manages sessions independently for each application. The administrative interface also forces the use of secure session cookies when the client is not &quot;localhost&quot;. For applications, it includes a powerful Role Based Access Control API.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``cryptographic store``:inxx &quot;Insecure Cryptographic Storage: Web applications rarely use cryptographic functions properly to protect data and credentials. Attackers use weakly protected data to conduct identity theft and other crimes, such as credit card fraud.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py uses the MD5 or the HMAC+SHA-512 hash algorithms to protect stored passwords. Other algorithms are also available.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``secure communications``:inxx &quot;Insecure Communications: Applications frequently fail to encrypt network traffic when it is necessary to protect sensitive communications.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes the SSL-enabled``ssl``:cite  Rocket WSGI server, but it can also use Apache or Lighttpd and mod_ssl to provide SSL encryption of communications.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class="insert">- ``access restriction``:inxx &quot;Failure to Restrict URL Access: Frequently an application only protects sensitive functionality by preventing the display of links or URLs to unauthorized users. Attackers can use this weakness to access and perform unauthorized operations by accessing those URLs directly.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py maps URL requests to Python modules and functions. web2py provides a mechanism for declaring which functions are public and which require authentication and authorization. The included Role Based Access Control API allow developers to restrict access to any function based on login, group membership or group based permissions. The permissions are very granular and can be combined with database filters to allow, for example, to give access to specific tables and/or records. web2py also allows digitally signed URL and provides API to digitally sign <span class="highlight">A</span>jax callbacks.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> web2py was reviewed for security and you can find the result of the review in ref.``pythonsecurity``:cite.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### In the box</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> You can download web2py from the official web site:</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ``</div><div class=""> http://www.web2py.com</div><div class=""> ``:code</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> web2py is composed of the following components:</div><div class=""> - **libraries**: provide core functionality of web2py and are accessible programmatically.</div><div class=""> - **web server**: the Rocket WSGI web server.</div><div class="insert">- the **admin** application: used to create, design, and manage other web2py applications. **admin** provide<span class="highlight">s</span> a complete web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building web2py applications.

Mail configuration and CAPTCHA are also discussed here, since they are used for authentication. In the third edition of the book we have added extensive coverage of integration with third-party authentication mechanisms such as OpenID, OAuth, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 10 is about creating web services in web2py. We provide examples of integration with the Google Web Toolkit via Pyjamas, and with Adobe Flash via PyAMF.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 11 is about web2py and jQuery recipes. web2py is designed mainly for server-side programming, but it includes jQuery, since we have found it to be the best open-source JavaScript library available for effects and Ajax. In this chapter, we discuss how to effectively use jQuery with web2py.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 12 discusses web2py components and plugins as a way to build modular applications. We provide an example of a plugin that implements many commonly used functionality, such as charting, comments, tagging, and wiki.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 13 is about production deployment of web2py applications. We mainly address three possible production scenarios: on a Linux web server or a set of servers (which we consider the main deployment alternative), running as a service on a Microsoft Windows environment, and deployment on the Google Applications Engine. In this chapter, we also discuss security and scalability issues.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 14 contains a variety of other recipes to solve specific tasks, including upgrades, geocoding, pagination, the Twitter API, and more.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> This book only covers basic web2py functionalities and the API that ships with web2py.</div><div class=""> This book does not cover web2py appliances (i.e. ready made applications).</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> You can download web2py appliances from the corresponding web site ``appliances``:cite.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> You can find additional topics discussed on the usergroup``usergroup``:cite.

XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim&#x27;s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, possibly introduce worms, etc.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py, by default, escapes all variables rendered in the view, preventing XSS.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``injection flaws``:inxx &quot;Injection Flaws: Injection flaws, particularly SQL injection, are common in web applications. Injection occurs when user-supplied data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker&#x27;s hostile data tricks the interpreter into executing unintended commands or changing data.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes a Database Abstraction Layer that makes SQL injection impossible. Normally, SQL statements are not written by the developer.  Instead, SQL is generated dynamically by the DAL, ensuring that all inserted data is properly escaped.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``malicious file execution``:inxx &quot;Malicious File Execution: Code vulnerable to remote file inclusion (RFI) allows attackers to include hostile code and data, resulting in devastating attacks, such as total server compromise.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py allows only exposed functions to be executed, preventing malicious file execution. Imported functions are never exposed; only actions are exposed. web2py uses a Web-based administration interface which makes it very easy to keep track of what is exposed and what is not.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``insecure object reference``:inxx &quot;Insecure Direct Object Reference: A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, database record, or key, as a URL or form parameter. Attackers can manipulate those references to access other objects without authorization.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py does not expose any internal objects; moreover, web2py validates all URLs, thus preventing directory traversal attacks. web2py also provides a simple mechanism to create forms that automatically validate all input values.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``CSRF``:inxx &quot;Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF): A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim&#x27;s browser to send a pre-authenticated request to a vulnerable web application, which then forces the victim&#x27;s browser to perform a hostile action to the benefit of the attacker. CSRF can be as powerful as the web application that it attacks.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py prevents CSRF as well as accidental double submission of forms by assigning a one-time random token to each form. Moreover web2py uses UUID for session cookie.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``information leakage``:inxx ``improper error handling``:inxx &quot;Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling: Applications can unintentionally leak information about their configuration, internal workings, or violate privacy through a variety of application problems. Attackers use this weakness to steal sensitive data, or conduct more serious attacks.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes a ticketing system. No error can result in code being exposed to the users. All errors are logged and a ticket is issued to the user that allows error tracking. But errors and source code are accessible only to the administrator.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - &quot;Broken Authentication and Session Management: Account credentials and session tokens are often not properly protected. Attackers compromise passwords, keys, or authentication tokens to assume other users&#x27; identities.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py provides a built-in mechanism for administrator authentication, and it manages sessions independently for each application. The administrative interface also forces the use of secure session cookies when the client is not &quot;localhost&quot;. For applications, it includes a powerful Role Based Access Control API.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``cryptographic store``:inxx &quot;Insecure Cryptographic Storage: Web applications rarely use cryptographic functions properly to protect data and credentials. Attackers use weakly protected data to conduct identity theft and other crimes, such as credit card fraud.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py uses the MD5 or the HMAC+SHA-512 hash algorithms to protect stored passwords. Other algorithms are also available.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``secure communications``:inxx &quot;Insecure Communications: Applications frequently fail to encrypt network traffic when it is necessary to protect sensitive communications.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes the SSL-enabled``ssl``:cite  Rocket WSGI server, but it can also use Apache or Lighttpd and mod_ssl to provide SSL encryption of communications.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class="delete">- ``access restriction``:inxx &quot;Failure to Restrict URL Access: Frequently an application only protects sensitive functionality by preventing the display of links or URLs to unauthorized users. Attackers can use this weakness to access and perform unauthorized operations by accessing those URLs directly.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py maps URL requests to Python modules and functions. web2py provides a mechanism for declaring which functions are public and which require authentication and authorization. The included Role Based Access Control API allow developers to restrict access to any function based on login, group membership or group based permissions. The permissions are very granular and can be combined with database filters to allow, for example, to give access to specific tables and/or records. web2py also allows digitally signed URL and provides API to digitally sign <span class="highlight">a</span>jax callbacks.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> web2py was reviewed for security and you can find the result of the review in ref.``pythonsecurity``:cite.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### In the box</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> You can download web2py from the official web site:</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ``</div><div class=""> http://www.web2py.com</div><div class=""> ``:code</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> web2py is composed of the following components:</div><div class=""> - **libraries**: provide core functionality of web2py and are accessible programmatically.</div><div class=""> - **web server**: the Rocket WSGI web server.</div><div class="delete">- the **admin** application: used to create, design, and manage other web2py applications. **admin** provide<span class="highlight"></span> a complete web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building web2py applications.

Mail configuration and CAPTCHA are also discussed here, since they are used for authentication. In the third edition of the book we have added extensive coverage of integration with third-party authentication mechanisms such as OpenID, OAuth, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 10 is about creating web services in web2py. We provide examples of integration with the Google Web Toolkit via Pyjamas, and with Adobe Flash via PyAMF.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 11 is about web2py and jQuery recipes. web2py is designed mainly for server-side programming, but it includes jQuery, since we have found it to be the best open-source JavaScript library available for effects and Ajax. In this chapter, we discuss how to effectively use jQuery with web2py.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 12 discusses web2py components and plugins as a way to build modular applications. We provide an example of a plugin that implements many commonly used functionality, such as charting, comments, tagging, and wiki.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 13 is about production deployment of web2py applications. We mainly address three possible production scenarios: on a Linux web server or a set of servers (which we consider the main deployment alternative), running as a service on a Microsoft Windows environment, and deployment on the Google Applications Engine. In this chapter, we also discuss security and scalability issues.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 14 contains a variety of other recipes to solve specific tasks, including upgrades, geocoding, pagination, the Twitter API, and more.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> This book only covers basic web2py functionalities and the API that ships with web2py.</div><div class=""> This book does not cover web2py appliances (i.e. ready made applications).</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> You can download web2py appliances from the corresponding web site ``appliances``:cite.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> You can find additional topics discussed on the usergroup``usergroup``:cite.

For this reason, web2py requires no installation and no configuration, has no dependencies (except for the source code distribution, which requires Python 2.5 and its standard library modules), and exposes most of its functionality via a Web interface, inc<span class="highlight">l</span>uding an Integrated Development Environment with Debugger and database interface.</div><div class=""> - web2py has been stable from day one because it follows a top-down design; i.e., its API was designed before it was implemented.

Its core libraries, including the Database Abstraction Layer, the template language, and all the helpers amount to 1.4MB. The entire source code including sample applications and images amounts to 10.4MB.</div><div class="insert">- web2py has a small footprint and is very fast. It uses the Rocket``rocket``:cite  WSGI web server developed by Timothy Farrell. It is as fast as Apache with mod_wsgi, <span class="highlight">and </span>supports <span class="highlight">SSL</span> and IPv6.</div><div class=""> - web2py uses Python syntax for models, controllers, and views, but does not import models and controllers (as all the other Python frameworks do) - instead it executes them. This means that apps can be installed, uninstalled, and modified without having to restart the web server (even in production), and different apps can coexist without their modules interfering with one another.</div><div class=""> - web2py uses a Database Abstraction Layer (DAL) instead of an Object Relational Mapper (ORM). From a conceptual point of view, this means that different database tables are mapped into different instances of one ``Table`` class and not into different classes, while records are mapped into instances of one ``Row`` class, not into instances of the corresponding table class. From a practical point of view, it means that SQL syntax maps almost one-to-one into DAL syntax, and there is no complex metaclass programming going on under the hood as in popular ORMs, which would add latency.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> WSGI ``wsgi-w``:cite ``wsgi-o``:cite (Web Server Gateway Interface) is an emerging Python standard for communication between a web server and Python applications).</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> Here is a screenshot of the main web2py **admin** interface:</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> [[image @///image/en200.png center 480px]]</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### Security</div><div class=""> ``security``:inxx</div><div class=""> The Open Web Application Security Project``owasp``:cite  (OWASP) is a free and open worldwide community focused</div><div class=""> on improving the security of application software.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> OWASP has listed the top ten security issues that put web applications at risk.</div><div class=""> That list is reproduced here, along with a description of how each issue is addressed by web2py:</div><div class=""> - ``cross site scripting``:inxx  &quot;Cross Site Scripting (XSS): XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes user supplied data and sends it to a web browser without first validating or encoding that content.

From a practical point of view, it means that SQL syntax maps almost one-to-one into DAL syntax, and there is no complex metaclass programming going on under the hood as in popular ORMs, which would add latency.</div></div></div>

XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim&#x27;s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, possibly introduce worms, etc.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py, by default, escapes all variables rendered in the view, preventing XSS.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``injection flaws``:inxx &quot;Injection Flaws: Injection flaws, particularly SQL injection, are common in web applications. Injection occurs when user-supplied data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker&#x27;s hostile data tricks the interpreter into executing unintended commands or changing data.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes a Database Abstraction Layer that makes SQL injection impossible. Normally, SQL statements are not written by the developer.  Instead, SQL is generated dynamically by the DAL, ensuring that all inserted data is properly escaped.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``malicious file execution``:inxx &quot;Malicious File Execution: Code vulnerable to remote file inclusion (RFI) allows attackers to include hostile code and data, resulting in devastating attacks, such as total server compromise.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py allows only exposed functions to be executed, preventing malicious file execution. Imported functions are never exposed; only actions are exposed. web2py uses a Web-based administration interface which makes it very easy to keep track of what is exposed and what is not.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``insecure object reference``:inxx &quot;Insecure Direct Object Reference: A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, database record, or key, as a URL or form parameter. Attackers can manipulate those references to access other objects without authorization.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py does not expose any internal objects; moreover, web2py validates all URLs, thus preventing directory traversal attacks. web2py also provides a simple mechanism to create forms that automatically validate all input values.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``CSRF``:inxx &quot;Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF): A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim&#x27;s browser to send a pre-authenticated request to a vulnerable web application, which then forces the victim&#x27;s browser to perform a hostile action to the benefit of the attacker. CSRF can be as powerful as the web application that it attacks.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py prevents CSRF as well as accidental double submission of forms by assigning a one-time random token to each form. Moreover web2py uses UUID for session cookie.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``information leakage``:inxx ``improper error handling``:inxx &quot;Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling: Applications can unintentionally leak information about their configuration, internal workings, or violate privacy through a variety of application problems. Attackers use this weakness to steal sensitive data, or conduct more serious attacks.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes a ticketing system. No error can result in code being exposed to the users. All errors are logged and a ticket is issued to the user that allows error tracking. But errors and source code are accessible only to the administrator.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - &quot;Broken Authentication and Session Management: Account credentials and session tokens are often not properly protected. Attackers compromise passwords, keys, or authentication tokens to assume other users&#x27; identities.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py provides a built-in mechanism for administrator authentication, and it manages sessions independently for each application. The administrative interface also forces the use of secure session cookies when the client is not &quot;localhost&quot;. For applications, it includes a powerful Role Based Access Control API.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``cryptographic store``:inxx &quot;Insecure Cryptographic Storage: Web applications rarely use cryptographic functions properly to protect data and credentials. Attackers use weakly protected data to conduct identity theft and other crimes, such as credit card fraud.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py uses the MD5 or the HMAC+SHA-512 hash algorithms to protect stored passwords. Other algorithms are also available.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``secure communications``:inxx &quot;Insecure Communications: Applications frequently fail to encrypt network traffic when it is necessary to protect sensitive communications.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes the SSL-enabled``ssl``:cite  Rocket WSGI server, but it can also use Apache or Lighttpd and mod_ssl to provide SSL encryption of communications.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class="insert">- ``access restriction``:inxx &quot;Failure to Restrict URL Access: Frequently an application only protects sensitive functionality by preventing the display of links or URLs to unauthorized users. Attackers can use this weakness to access and perform unauthorized operations by accessing those URLs directly.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py maps URL requests to Python modules and functions. web2py provides a mechanism for declaring which functions are public and which require authentication and authorization. The included Role Based Access Control API allow developers to restrict access to any function based on login, group membership or group based permissions. The permissions are very granular and can be combined with <span class="highlight">database filters</span> to allow, for example, to give access to specific tables and/or records. web2py also allows digitally signed URL and provides API to digitally sign ajax callbacks.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> web2py was reviewed for security and you can find the result of the review in ref.``pythonsecurity``:cite.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### In the box</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> You can download web2py from the official web site:</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ``</div><div class=""> http://www.web2py.com</div><div class=""> ``:code</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> web2py is composed of the following components:</div><div class=""> - **libraries**: provide core functionality of web2py and are accessible programmatically.</div><div class=""> - **web server**: the Rocket WSGI web server.</div><div class=""> - the **admin** application: used to create, design, and manage other web2py applications. **admin** provide a complete web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building web2py applications.

It assumes knowledge of both procedural and object-oriented programming concepts such as loops, conditions, function calls and classes, and covers basic Python syntax. It also covers examples of Python modules that are used throughout the book. If you already know Python, you may skip Chapter 2.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 3 shows how to start web2py, discusses the administrative interface, and guides the reader through various examples of increasing complexity: an application that returns a string, a counter application, an image blog, and a full blown wiki application that allows image uploads and comments, provides authentication, authorization, web services and an RSS feed. While reading this chapter, you may need to refer to Chapter 2 for general Python syntax and to the following chapters for a more detailed reference about the functions that are used.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 4 covers more systematically the core structure and libraries: URL mapping, request, response, sessions, caching, cron, internationalization and general workflow.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 5 is a reference for the template language used to build views. It shows how to embed Python code into HTML, and demonstrates the use of helpers (objects that can generate HTML).</div><div class=""> - Chapter 6 covers the Database Abstraction Layer, or DAL. The syntax of the DAL is presented through a series of examples.</div><div class="insert">- Chapter 7 covers forms, form validation and form processing. FORM is the low level helper for form building. SQLFORM is the high level form builder.

XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim&#x27;s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, possibly introduce worms, etc.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py, by default, escapes all variables rendered in the view, preventing XSS.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``injection flaws``:inxx &quot;Injection Flaws: Injection flaws, particularly SQL injection, are common in web applications. Injection occurs when user-supplied data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker&#x27;s hostile data tricks the interpreter into executing unintended commands or changing data.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes a Database Abstraction Layer that makes SQL injection impossible. Normally, SQL statements are not written by the developer.  Instead, SQL is generated dynamically by the DAL, ensuring that all inserted data is properly escaped.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``malicious file execution``:inxx &quot;Malicious File Execution: Code vulnerable to remote file inclusion (RFI) allows attackers to include hostile code and data, resulting in devastating attacks, such as total server compromise.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py allows only exposed functions to be executed, preventing malicious file execution. Imported functions are never exposed; only actions are exposed. web2py uses a Web-based administration interface which makes it very easy to keep track of what is exposed and what is not.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``insecure object reference``:inxx &quot;Insecure Direct Object Reference: A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, database record, or key, as a URL or form parameter. Attackers can manipulate those references to access other objects without authorization.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py does not expose any internal objects; moreover, web2py validates all URLs, thus preventing directory traversal attacks. web2py also provides a simple mechanism to create forms that automatically validate all input values.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``CSRF``:inxx &quot;Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF): A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim&#x27;s browser to send a pre-authenticated request to a vulnerable web application, which then forces the victim&#x27;s browser to perform a hostile action to the benefit of the attacker. CSRF can be as powerful as the web application that it attacks.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py prevents CSRF as well as accidental double submission of forms by assigning a one-time random token to each form. Moreover web2py uses UUID for session cookie.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``information leakage``:inxx ``improper error handling``:inxx &quot;Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling: Applications can unintentionally leak information about their configuration, internal workings, or violate privacy through a variety of application problems. Attackers use this weakness to steal sensitive data, or conduct more serious attacks.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes a ticketing system. No error can result in code being exposed to the users. All errors are logged and a ticket is issued to the user that allows error tracking. But errors and source code are accessible only to the administrator.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - &quot;Broken Authentication and Session Management: Account credentials and session tokens are often not properly protected. Attackers compromise passwords, keys, or authentication tokens to assume other users&#x27; identities.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py provides a built-in mechanism for administrator authentication, and it manages sessions independently for each application. The administrative interface also forces the use of secure session cookies when the client is not &quot;localhost&quot;. For applications, it includes a powerful Role Based Access Control API.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``cryptographic store``:inxx &quot;Insecure Cryptographic Storage: Web applications rarely use cryptographic functions properly to protect data and credentials. Attackers use weakly protected data to conduct identity theft and other crimes, such as credit card fraud.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py uses the MD5 or the HMAC+SHA-512 hash algorithms to protect stored passwords. Other algorithms are also available.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> - ``secure communications``:inxx &quot;Insecure Communications: Applications frequently fail to encrypt network traffic when it is necessary to protect sensitive communications.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py includes the SSL-enabled``ssl``:cite  Rocket WSGI server, but it can also use Apache or Lighttpd and mod_ssl to provide SSL encryption of communications.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class="delete">- ``access restriction``:inxx &quot;Failure to Restrict URL Access: Frequently an application only protects sensitive functionality by preventing the display of links or URLs to unauthorized users. Attackers can use this weakness to access and perform unauthorized operations by accessing those URLs directly.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;web2py maps URL requests to Python modules and functions. web2py provides a mechanism for declaring which functions are public and which require authentication and authorization. The included Role Based Access Control API allow developers to restrict access to any function based on login, group membership or group based permissions. The permissions are very granular and can be combined with <span class="highlight">CRUD</span> to allow, for example, to give access to specific tables and/or records. web2py also allows digitally signed URL and provides API to digitally sign ajax callbacks.&#x27;&#x27;</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> web2py was reviewed for security and you can find the result of the review in ref.``pythonsecurity``:cite.</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ### In the box</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> You can download web2py from the official web site:</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> ``</div><div class=""> http://www.web2py.com</div><div class=""> ``:code</div><div class=""> </div><div class=""> web2py is composed of the following components:</div><div class=""> - **libraries**: provide core functionality of web2py and are accessible programmatically.</div><div class=""> - **web server**: the Rocket WSGI web server.</div><div class=""> - the **admin** application: used to create, design, and manage other web2py applications. **admin** provide a complete web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building web2py applications.

It assumes knowledge of both procedural and object-oriented programming concepts such as loops, conditions, function calls and classes, and covers basic Python syntax. It also covers examples of Python modules that are used throughout the book. If you already know Python, you may skip Chapter 2.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 3 shows how to start web2py, discusses the administrative interface, and guides the reader through various examples of increasing complexity: an application that returns a string, a counter application, an image blog, and a full blown wiki application that allows image uploads and comments, provides authentication, authorization, web services and an RSS feed. While reading this chapter, you may need to refer to Chapter 2 for general Python syntax and to the following chapters for a more detailed reference about the functions that are used.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 4 covers more systematically the core structure and libraries: URL mapping, request, response, sessions, caching, cron, internationalization and general workflow.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 5 is a reference for the template language used to build views. It shows how to embed Python code into HTML, and demonstrates the use of helpers (objects that can generate HTML).</div><div class=""> - Chapter 6 covers the Database Abstraction Layer, or DAL. The syntax of the DAL is presented through a series of examples.</div><div class="delete">- Chapter 7 covers forms, form validation and form processing. FORM is the low level helper for form building. SQLFORM is the high level form builder. In Chapter 7 we also discuss <span class="highlight">the</span> Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) API.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 8 covers communication with as sending emails and SMSes.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 9 covers authentication, authorization and the extensible Role-Based Access Control mechanism available in web2py. Mail configuration and CAPTCHA are also discussed here, since they are used for authentication. In the third edition of the book we have added extensive coverage of integration with third-party authentication mechanisms such as OpenID, OAuth, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 10 is about creating web services in web2py. We provide examples of integration with the Google Web Toolkit via Pyjamas, and with Adobe Flash via PyAMF.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 11 is about web2py and jQuery recipes. web2py is designed mainly for server-side programming, but it includes jQuery, since we have found it to be the best open-source JavaScript library available for effects and Ajax. In this chapter, we discuss how to effectively use jQuery with web2py.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 12 discusses web2py components and plugins as a way to build modular applications. We provide an example of a plugin that implements many commonly used functionality, such as charting, comments, tagging, and wiki.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 13 is about production deployment of web2py applications. We mainly address three possible production scenarios: on a Linux web server or a set of servers (which we consider the main deployment alternative), running as a service on a Microsoft Windows environment, and deployment on the Google Applications Engine. In this chapter, we also discuss security and scalability issues.</div><div class=""> - Chapter 14 contains a variety of other recipes to solve specific tasks, including upgrades, geocoding, pagination, the Twitter API, and more.</div></div></div>

    <div class="span6"><div class="diff"><div class=""> web2py is one of many web application frameworks, but it has compelling and unique features.</div><div class=""> web2py was originally developed as a teaching tool, with the following primary motivations:</div><div class=""> - Easy for users to learn server-side web development without compromising functionality. For this reason, web2py requires no installation and no configuration, has no dependencies (except for the source code distribution, which requires Python 2.5 and its standard library modules), and exposes most of its functionality via a Web browser interface.</div><div class=""> - web2py has been stable from day one because it follows a top-down design; i.e., its API was designed before it was implemented. Even as new functionality has been added, web2py has never broken backwards compatibility, and it will not break compatibility when additional functionality is added in the future.</div><div class=""> - web2py proactively addresses the most important security issues which plague many modern web applications, as determined by OWASP``owasp``:cite  below.</div><div class=""> - web2py is lightweight. Its core libraries, including the Database Abstraction Layer, the template language, and all the helpers amount to 1.4MB. The entire source code including sample applications and images amounts to 10.4MB.</div><div class=""> - web2py has a small footprint and is very fast. It uses the Rocket``rocket``:cite  WSGI web server developed By Timothy Farrell. It is as fast as Apache with mod_wsgi. Our tests also indicate that, on an average PC, it serves an average dynamic page without database access in about 10ms. The DAL has very low overhead, typically less than 3%.</div><div class="insert">- web2py uses Python syntax for models, controllers, and views, but does not import models and controllers (as all the other Python frameworks do) - instead it executes them. This means that apps can be installed, uninstalled, and modified without having to restart the web server (even in production), and different apps can co<span class="highlight"></span>exist without their modules interfering with one another.</div><div class=""> - web2py uses a Database Abstraction Layer (DAL) instead of an Object Relational Mapper (ORM). From a conceptual point of view, this means that different database tables are mapped into different instances of one ``Table`` class and not into different classes, while records are mapped into instances of one ``Row`` class, not into instances of the corresponding table class. From a practical point of view, it means that SQL syntax maps almost one-to-one into DAL syntax, and there is no complex metaclass programming going on under the hood as in popular ORMs, which would add latency.</div></div></div>
