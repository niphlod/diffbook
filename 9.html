``Auth``:inxx ``Access Control``:inxx ``RBAC``:inxx ``DAC``:inxx ``MAC``:inxx

web2py includes a powerful and customizable Role Based Access Control mechanism (RBAC).

Here is a definition from Wikipedia:

&quot;Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is a newer alternative approach to mandatory access control (MAC) and discretionary access control (DAC). RBAC is sometimes referred to as role-based security.

RBAC is a policy neutral and flexible access control technology sufficiently powerful to simulate DAC and MAC. Conversely, MAC can simulate RBAC if the role graph is restricted to a tree rather than a partially ordered set.

Prior to the development of RBAC, MAC and DAC were considered to be the only known models for access control: if a model was not MAC, it was considered to be a DAC model, and vice versa. Research in the late 1990s demonstrated that RBAC falls in neither category.

Within an organization, roles are created for various job functions. The permissions to perform certain operations are assigned to specific roles. Members of staff (or other system users) are assigned particular roles, and through those role assignments acquire the permissions to perform particular system functions. Unlike context-based access control (CBAC), RBAC does not look at the message context (such as a connection&#x27;s source).

Since users are not assigned permissions directly, but only acquire them through their role (or roles), management of individual user rights becomes a matter of simply assigning appropriate roles to the user; this simplifies common operations, such as adding a user, or changing a user&#x27;s department.

RBAC differs from access control lists (ACLs) used in traditional discretionary access control systems in that it assigns permissions to specific operations with meaning in the organization, rather than to low level data objects. For example, an access control list could be used to grant or deny write access to a particular system file, but it would not dictate how that file could be changed.&quot;

The web2py class that implements RBAC is called **Auth**.

**Auth** needs (and defines) the following tables:
- ``auth_user`` stores users&#x27; name, email address, password, and status (registration pending, accepted, blocked)
- ``auth_group`` stores groups or roles for users in a many-to-many structure. By default, each user is in its own group, but a user can be in multiple groups, and each group can contain multiple users. A group is identified by a role and a description.
- ``auth_membership`` links users and groups in a many-to-many structure.
- ``auth_permission`` links groups and permissions. A permission is identified by a name and, optionally, a table and a record. For example, members of a certain group can have &quot;update&quot; permissions on a specific record of a specific table.
- ``auth_event`` logs changes in the other tables and successful access via CRUD to objects controlled by the RBAC.

In principle, there is no restriction on the names of the roles and the names of the permissions; the developer can create them to fix the roles and permissions in the organization. Once they have been created, web2py provides an API to check if a user is logged in, if a user is a member of a given group, and/or if the user is a member of any group that has a given required permission.

web2py also provides decorators to restrict access to any function based on login, membership and permissions.

web2py also understands some specific permissions, i.e., those that have a name that correspond to the CRUD methods (create, read, update, delete) and can enforce them automatically without the need to use decorators.

In this chapter, we are going to discuss different parts of RBAC one by one.

### Authentication

In order to use RBAC, users need to be identified. This means that they need to register (or be registered) and log in.

**Auth** provides multiple login methods. The default one consists of identifying users based on the local ``auth_user`` table.
Alternatively, it can log in users against third-party authentication systems and single sign on providers such as Google, PAM, LDAP, Facebook, LinkedIn, Dropbox, OpenID, OAuth, etc..

To start using ``Auth``, you need at least this code in a model file, which is also provided with the web2py &quot;welcome&quot; application and assumes a ``db`` connection object:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
``:code

Auth has an optional ``secure=True`` argument, which will force authenticated pages to go over HTTPS. ``https``:inxx

-------
The ``password`` field of the ``db.auth_user`` table defaults to a ``CRYPT`` validator, which needs and ``hmac_key``. On legacy web2py applications you may see an extra argument passed to the Auth constructor: ``hmac_key = Auth.get_or_create_key()``. The latter is a function that read the hmac kay from a file &quot;private/auth.key&quot; within the application folder. If the file does not exist it creates a random ``hmac_key``. If multiple apps share the same auth database, make sure they also use the same ``hmac_key``. This is no loger necessary for new applications since passwords are salted with an individual random salt.
-------

By default, web2py uses email for login. If instead you want to log in using username set ``auth.define_tables(username=True)``

If multiple apps share the same auth database you may want to disable migrations: ``auth.define_tables(migrate=False)``.

To expose **Auth**, you also need the following function in a controller (for example in &quot;default.py&quot;):
``
def user(): return dict(form=auth())
``:code

-------
The ``auth`` object and the ``user`` action are already defined in the
scaffolding application.
-------

web2py also includes a sample view &quot;welcome/views/default/user.html&quot; to render this function properly that looks like this:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;{{=T( request.args(0).replace(&#x27;_&#x27;,&#x27; &#x27;).capitalize() )}}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;web2py_user_form&quot;&gt;
  {{=form}}
  {{if request.args(0)==&#x27;login&#x27;:}}
    {{if not &#x27;register&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;register&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
    {{if not &#x27;request_reset_password&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;lost password&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
  {{pass}}
&lt;/div&gt;
``:code

Notice that this function simply displays a ``form`` and therefore it can be customized using normal custom form syntax. The only caveat is that the form displayed by ``form=auth()`` depends on ``request.args(0)``; therefore, if you replace the default ``auth()`` login form with a custom login form, you may need an ``if`` statement like this in the view:
``
{{if request.args(0)==&#x27;login&#x27;:}}...custom login form...{{pass}}
``:code

``auth.impersonate``:inxx ``auth.is_impersonating``:inxx

The controller above exposes multiple actions:
``
http://.../[app]/default/user/register
http://.../[app]/default/user/login
http://.../[app]/default/user/logout
http://.../[app]/default/user/profile
http://.../[app]/default/user/change_password
http://.../[app]/default/user/verify_email
http://.../[app]/default/user/retrieve_username
http://.../[app]/default/user/request_reset_password
http://.../[app]/default/user/reset_password
http://.../[app]/default/user/impersonate
http://.../[app]/default/user/groups
http://.../[app]/default/user/not_authorized
``:code
- **register** allows users to register. It is integrated with CAPTCHA, although this is disabled by default. This is also integrated with a client-side entropy calculator defined in &quot;web2py.js&quot;. The calculator indictates the strenght of the new password. You can use the ``IS_STRONG`` validator to prevent web2py from accepting weak passwords.
- **login** allows users who are registered to log in (if the registration is verified or does not require verification, if it has been approved or does not require approval, and if it has not been blocked).
- **logout** does what you would expect but also, as the other methods, logs the event and can be used to trigger some event.
- **profile** allows users to edit their profile, i.e. the content of the ``auth_user`` table. Notice that this table does not have a fixed structure and can be customized.
- **change_password** allows users to change their password in a fail-safe way.
- **verify_email**. If email verification is turned on, then visitors, upon registration, receive an email with a link to verify their email information. The link points to this action.
- **retrieve_username**. By default, **Auth** uses email and password for login, but it can, optionally, use username instead of email. In this latter case, if a user forgets his/her username, the ``retrieve_username`` method allows the user to type the email address and retrieve the username by email.
- **request_reset_password**. Allows users who forgot their password to request a new password. They will get a confirmation email pointing to **reset_password**.
- **impersonate** allows a user to &quot;impersonate&quot; another user. This is important for debugging and for support purposes. ``request.args[0]`` is the id of the user to be impersonated. This is only allowed if the logged in user ``has_permission(&#x27;impersonate&#x27;, db.auth_user, user_id)``. You can use ``auth.is_impersonating()`` to check is the current user is impersonating somebody else.
- **groups** lists the groups of which the current logged in user is a member.
- **not_authorized** displays an error message when the visitor tried to do something that he/she is not authorized to do
- **navbar** is a helper that generates a bar with login/register/etc. links.

Logout, profile, change_password, impersonate, and groups require login.

By default they are all exposed, but it is possible to restrict access to only some of these actions.

All of the methods above can be extended or replaced by subclassing **Auth**.

All of the methods above can be used in separate actions. For example:

``
def mylogin(): return dict(form=auth.login())
def myregister(): return dict(form=auth.register())
def myprofile(): return dict(form=auth.profile())
...
``

To restrict access to functions to only logged in visitors, decorate the function as in the following example
``
@auth.requires_login()
def hello():
    return dict(message=&#x27;hello %(first_name)s&#x27; % auth.user)
``:code

Any function can be decorated, not just exposed actions. Of course this is still only a very simple example of access control. More complex examples will be discussed later.
``auth.user``:inxx ``auth.user_id``:inxx ``auth.user_groups``.

-----
``auth.user`` contains a copy of the ``db.auth_user`` records for the current logged in user or ``None`` otherwise. There is also a ``auth.user_id`` which is the same as ``auth.user.id`` (i.e. the id of the current logger in user) or ``None``. Similarly, ``auth.user_groups`` contains a dictionary where each key is the id of a group of with the current logged in user is member of, the value is the corresponding group role.
-----

``otherwise``:inxx

The ``auth.requires_login()`` decorator as well as the other ``auth.requires_*`` decorators take an optional ``otherwise`` argument. It can be set to a string where to redirect the user if registration files or to a callable object. It is called if registration fails.

#### Restrictions on registration

If you want to allow visitors to register but not to log in until registration has been approved by the administrator:
``
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = True
``:code

You can approve a registration via the appadmin interface. Look into the table ``auth_user``. Pending registrations have a ``registration_key`` field set to &quot;pending&quot;. A registration is approved when this field is set to blank.

Via the appadmin interface, you can also block a user from logging in. Locate the user in the table ``auth_user`` and set the ``registration_key`` to &quot;blocked&quot;. &quot;blocked&quot; users are not allowed to log in. Notice that this will prevent a visitor from logging in but it will not force a visitor who is already logged in to log out. The word &quot;disabled&quot; may be used instead of &quot;blocked&quot; if preferred, with exactly the same behavior.

You can also block access to the &quot;register&quot; page completely with this statement:
``
auth.settings.actions_disabled.append(&#x27;register&#x27;)
``:code

If you want to allow people to register and automatically log them in after registration but still want to send an email for verification so that they cannot login again after logout, unless they completed the instructions in the email, you can accomplish it as follows:

``
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = True
auth.settings.login_after_registration = True
``:code


Other methods of **Auth** can be restricted in the same way.

You can use the web2py Role Base Access Control and authenticate with other services like OpenID, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, Dropbox, MySpace, Flickr, etc.
The easiest way is to use Janrain Engage (formerly RPX) (Janrain.com).

Dropbox is discussed as a special case in Chapter 14 since it allows more than just login, it also provides storage services for the logged in users.

Janrain Engage is a service that provides middleware authentication. You can register with Janrain.com, register a domain (the name of your app) and set of URLs you will be using, and they will provide you with an API key.

Now edit the model of your web2py application and place the following lines somewhere after the definition of the ``auth`` object :

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.rpx_account import RPXAccount
auth.settings.actions_disabled=[&#x27;register&#x27;,&#x27;change_password&#x27;,&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;]
auth.settings.login_form = RPXAccount(request,
    api_key=&#x27;...&#x27;,
    domain=&#x27;...&#x27;,
    url = &quot;http://localhost:8000/%s/default/user/login&quot; % request.application)
``:code

The first line imports the new login method, the second line disables local registration, and the third line asks web2py to use the RPX login method. You must insert your own ``api_key`` provided by Janrain.com, the domain you choose upon registration and the external ``url`` of your login page.

[[image @///image/en6900.png center 300px]]

When a new user logins for the first time, web2py creates a new ``db.auth_user`` record associated to the user. It will use the ``registration_id`` field to store a unique id for the user. Most authentication methods will also provide a username, email, first_name and last_name but that is not guaranteed. Which fields are provided depends on the login method selected by the user. If the same user logs in twice using different authentication mechanisms (for example once with OpenID and once with Facebook), Janrain may not recognize his/her as the same user and issue different ``registration_id``.

You can customize the mapping between the data provided by Janrain and the data stored in ``db.auth_user``. Here is an example for Facebook:
``
auth.settings.login_form.mappings.Facebook = lambda profile:\
            dict(registration_id = profile[&quot;identifier&quot;],
                 username = profile[&quot;preferredUsername&quot;],
                 email = profile[&quot;email&quot;],
                 first_name = profile[&quot;name&quot;][&quot;givenName&quot;],
                 last_name = profile[&quot;name&quot;][&quot;familyName&quot;])
``:code

The keys in the dictionary are fields in ``db.auth_user`` and the values are data entries in the profile object provided by Janrain. Look at the online Janrain documentation for details on the latter.

Janrain will also keep statistics about your users&#x27; login.

This login form is fully integrated with web2py Role Based Access Control and you can still create groups, make users members of groups, assign permissions, block users, etc.

-----
Janrain&#x27;s free Basic service allows up to 2500 unique registered users to sign in annually. Accommodating more users requires an upgrade to one of their paid service tiers.

If you prefer not to use Janrain and want to use a different login method (LDAP, PAM, Google, OpenID, OAuth/Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) you can do so. The API to do so is described later in the chapter.
-----

#### CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA

``CAPTCHA``:inxx ``reCAPTCHA``:inxx ``PIL``:inxx
To prevent spammers and bots registering on your site, you may require a registration CAPTCHA. web2py supports reCAPTCHA``recaptcha``:cite  out of the box. This is because reCAPTCHA is very well designed, free, accessible (it can read the words to the visitors), easy to set up, and does not require installing any third-party libraries.

This is what you need to do to use reCAPTCHA:
- Register with reCAPTCHA``recaptcha``:cite  and obtain a (PUBLIC_KEY, PRIVATE_KEY) couple for your account. These are just two strings.
- Append the following code to your model after the ``auth`` object is defined:
``
from gluon.tools import Recaptcha
auth.settings.captcha = Recaptcha(request,
    &#x27;PUBLIC_KEY&#x27;, &#x27;PRIVATE_KEY&#x27;)
``:code

reCAPTCHA may not work if you access the web site as &#x27;localhost&#x27; or &#x27;127.0.0.1&#x27;, because it is registered to work with publicly visible web sites only.

The ``Recaptcha`` constructor takes some optional arguments:
``
Recaptcha(..., use_ssl=True, error_message=&#x27;invalid&#x27;, label=&#x27;Verify:&#x27;, options=&#x27;&#x27;)
``:code

Notice that ``use_ssl=False`` by default.

``options`` may be a configuration string, e.g. ``options=&quot;theme:&#x27;white&#x27;, lang:&#x27;fr&#x27;&quot;``

More details: [[reCAPTCHA http://www.google.com/recaptcha]]``recaptchagoogle``:cite  and [[customizing http://code.google.com/apis/recaptcha/docs/customization.html]]  .

If you do not want to use reCAPTCHA, look into the definition of the ``Recaptcha`` class in &quot;gluon/tools.py&quot;, since it is easy to use other CAPTCHA systems.

Notice that ``Recaptcha`` is just a helper that extends ``DIV``. It generates a dummy field that validates using the ``reCaptcha`` service and, therefore, it can be used in any form, including used defined FORMs:

``
form = FORM(INPUT(...),Recaptcha(...),INPUT(_type=&#x27;submit&#x27;))
``:code

You can use it in all types of SQLFORM by injection:

``
form = SQLFORM(...) or SQLFORM.factory(...)
form.element(&#x27;table&#x27;).insert(-1,TR(&#x27;&#x27;,Recaptcha(...),&#x27;&#x27;))
``:code

#### Customizing ``Auth``

The call to
``
auth.define_tables()
``:code

defines all **Auth** tables that have not been defined already. This means that if you wish to do so, you can define your own ``auth_user`` table.

There are a number of ways to customize auth. The simplest way is to add extra fields:

``
## after auth = Auth(db)
auth.settings.extra_fields[&#x27;auth_user&#x27;]= [
  Field(&#x27;address&#x27;),
  Field(&#x27;city&#x27;),
  Field(&#x27;zip&#x27;),
  Field(&#x27;phone&#x27;)]
## before auth.define_tables(username=True)
``

You can declare extra fields not just for table &quot;auth_user&quot; but also for other &quot;auth_&quot; tables.
Using ``extra_fields`` is the recommended way as it will not break any internal mechanism.

Another way to do this, although not really recommended, consists of defining your auth tables yourself. If a table is declared before ``auth.define_tables()`` it is used instead of the default one. Here is how to do it:

``
## after auth = Auth(db)
db.define_table(
    auth.settings.table_user_name,
    Field(&#x27;first_name&#x27;, length=128, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;last_name&#x27;, length=128, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;email&#x27;, length=128, default=&#x27;&#x27;, unique=True), # required
    Field(&#x27;password&#x27;, &#x27;password&#x27;, length=512,            # required
          readable=False, label=&#x27;Password&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;address&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;city&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;zip&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;phone&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;registration_key&#x27;, length=512,                # required
          writable=False, readable=False, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;reset_password_key&#x27;, length=512,              # required
          writable=False, readable=False, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;registration_id&#x27;, length=512,                 # required
          writable=False, readable=False, default=&#x27;&#x27;))

## do not forget validators
custom_auth_table = db[auth.settings.table_user_name] # get the custom_auth_table
custom_auth_table.first_name.requires = \
  IS_NOT_EMPTY(error_message=auth.messages.is_empty)
custom_auth_table.last_name.requires = \
  IS_NOT_EMPTY(error_message=auth.messages.is_empty)
custom_auth_table.password.requires = [IS_STRONG(), CRYPT()]
custom_auth_table.email.requires = [
  IS_EMAIL(error_message=auth.messages.invalid_email),
  IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, custom_auth_table.email)]

auth.settings.table_user = custom_auth_table # tell auth to use custom_auth_table

## before auth.define_tables()
``:code

You can add any field you wish, and you can change validators but you cannot remove
the fields marked as &quot;required&quot; in this example.

It is important to make &quot;password&quot;, &quot;registration_key&quot;, &quot;reset_password_key&quot; and &quot;registration_id&quot; fields ``readable=False`` and ``writable=False``, since a visitor must not be allowed to tamper with them.

If you add a field called &quot;username&quot;, it will be used in place of &quot;email&quot; for login. If you do, you will need to add a validator as well:
``
auth_table.username.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, auth_table.username)
``:code

#### Renaming ``Auth`` tables

The actual names of the ``Auth`` tables are stored in
``
auth.settings.table_user_name = &#x27;auth_user&#x27;
auth.settings.table_group_name = &#x27;auth_group&#x27;
auth.settings.table_membership_name = &#x27;auth_membership&#x27;
auth.settings.table_permission_name = &#x27;auth_permission&#x27;
auth.settings.table_event_name = &#x27;auth_event&#x27;
``:code

The names of the table can be changed by reassigning the above variables after the ``auth`` object is defined and before the Auth tables are defined. For example:
``
auth = Auth(db)
auth.settings.table_user_name = &#x27;person&#x27;
#...
auth.define_tables()
``:code

The actual tables can also be referenced, independently of their actual names, by
``
auth.settings.table_user
auth.settings.table_group
auth.settings.table_membership
auth.settings.table_permission
auth.settings.table_event
``:code

#### Other login methods and login forms
``LDAP``:inxx ``PAM``:inxx

Auth provides multiple login methods and hooks to create new login methods. Each supported login method corresponds to a file in the folder
``
gluon/contrib/login_methods/
``:code

Refer to the documentation in the files themselves for each login method, but here are some examples.

First of all, we need to make a distinction between two types of alternate login methods:
- login methods that use a web2py login form (although the credentials are verified outside web2py). An example is LDAP.
- login methods that require an external single-sign-on form (an example is Google and Facebook).

In the latter case, web2py never gets the login credentials, only a login token issued by the service provider. The token is stored in ``db.auth_user.registration_id``.

Let&#x27;s consider examples of the first case:

##### Basic

Let&#x27;s say you have an authentication service, for example at the url

``
https://basic.example.com
``:code

that accepts basic access authentication. That means the server accepts HTTP requests with a header of the form:

``
GET /index.html HTTP/1.0
Host: basic.example.com
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
``:code

where the latter string is the base64 encoding of the string username:password. The service responds 200 OK if the user is authorized and 400, 401, 402, 403 or 404 otherwise.

You want to enter username and password using the standard ``Auth`` login form and verify the credentials against such a service. All you need to do is add the following code to your application
``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.basic_auth import basic_auth
auth.settings.login_methods.append(
    basic_auth(&#x27;https://basic.example.com&#x27;))
``:code

Notice that ``auth.settings.login_methods`` is a list of authentication methods that are executed sequentially.
By default it is set to
``
auth.settings.login_methods = [auth]
``:code

When an alternate method is appended, for example ``basic_auth``, **Auth** first tries to log in the visitor based on the content of ``auth_user``, and when this fails, it tries the next method in the list. If a method succeeds in logging in the visitor, and if ``auth.settings.login_methods[0]==auth``, ``Auth`` takes the following actions:
- if the user does not exist in ``auth_user``, a new user is created and the username/email and passwords are stored.
- if the user does exist in ``auth_user`` but the new accepted password does not match the old stored password, the old password is replaced with the new one (notice that passwords are always stored hashed unless specified otherwise).

If you do not wish to store the new password in ``auth_user``, then it is sufficient to change the order of login methods, or remove ``auth`` from the list. For example:
``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.basic_auth import basic_auth
auth.settings.login_methods = \
    [basic_auth(&#x27;https://basic.example.com&#x27;)]
``:code

The same applies for any other login method described here.

##### SMTP and Gmail
``SMTP``:inxx ``Gmail``:inxx

You can verify login credentials using a remote SMTP server, for example Gmail; i.e., you log the user in if the email and password they provide are valid credentials to access the Gmail SMTP server (``smtp.gmail.com:587``). All that is needed is the following code:
``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.email_auth import email_auth
auth.settings.login_methods.append(
    email_auth(&quot;smtp.gmail.com:587&quot;, &quot;@gmail.com&quot;))
``:code

The first argument of ``email_auth`` is the address:port of the SMTP server. The second argument is the email domain.

This works with any SMTP server that requires TLS authentication.``TLS``:inxx

##### PAM
``PAM``:inxx

Authentication using Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) works as in the previous cases. It allows web2py to authenticate users using the operating system accounts:
``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.pam_auth import pam_auth
auth.settings.login_methods.append(pam_auth())
``:code

##### LDAP
``LDAP``:inxx

Authentication using LDAP works very much as in the previous cases.

To use LDAP login with MS Active Directory:``Active Directory``:inxx
``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.ldap_auth import ldap_auth
auth.settings.login_methods.append(ldap_auth(mode=&#x27;ad&#x27;,
   server=&#x27;my.domain.controller&#x27;,
   base_dn=&#x27;ou=Users,dc=domain,dc=com&#x27;))
``:code

To use LDAP login with Lotus Notes and Domino:``Lotus Notes``:inxx ``Domino``:inxx
``
auth.settings.login_methods.append(ldap_auth(mode=&#x27;domino&#x27;,
   server=&#x27;my.domino.server&#x27;))
``:code

To use LDAP login with OpenLDAP (with UID):``OpenLDAP``:inxx
``
auth.settings.login_methods.append(ldap_auth(server=&#x27;my.ldap.server&#x27;,
   base_dn=&#x27;ou=Users,dc=domain,dc=com&#x27;))
``:code

To use LDAP login with OpenLDAP (with CN):
``
auth.settings.login_methods.append(ldap_auth(mode=&#x27;cn&#x27;,
   server=&#x27;my.ldap.server&#x27;, base_dn=&#x27;ou=Users,dc=domain,dc=com&#x27;))
``:code

##### Google App Engine
``GAE login``:inxx

Authentication using Google when running on Google App Engine requires skipping the web2py login form, being redirected to the Google login page, and back upon success. Because the behavior is different than in the previous examples, the API is a little different.

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.gae_google_login import GaeGoogleAccount
auth.settings.login_form = GaeGoogleAccount()
``:code

##### OpenID
``OpenID``:inxx

We have previously discussed integration with Janrain (which has OpenID support) and that is the easiest way to use OpenID. Yet sometimes you do not want to rely on a third party service and you want to access the OpenID provider directly from the consumer (your app).

Here is an example:

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.openid_auth import OpenIDAuth
auth.settings.login_form = OpenIDAuth(auth)
``:code

``OpenIDAuth`` requires the &#x27;&#x27;python-openid&#x27;&#x27; module to be installed separately. Under the hood, this login method defines the following table:

``
db.define_table(&#x27;alt_logins&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;username&#x27;, length=512, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;type&#x27;, length =128, default=&#x27;openid&#x27;, readable=False),
    Field(&#x27;user&#x27;, self.table_user, readable=False))
``:code

which stores the openid usernames for each user. If you want to display the openids for the current logged in user:

``
{{=auth.settings.login_form.list_user_openids()}}
``:code

##### OAuth2.0 and Facebook
``OAuth``:inxx ``Facebook``:inxx

We have previously discussed integration with Janrain (which has Facebook support), yet sometimes you do not want to rely on a third party service and you want to access a OAuth2.0 provider directly; for example, Facebook. Here is how:

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.oauth20_account import OAuthAccount
auth.settings.login_form=OAuthAccount(YOUR_CLIENT_ID,YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET)
``:code

Things get a little more complex if you want to use Facebook OAuth2.0 to login into a specific Facebook app to access its API, instead of your own app. Here is an example for accessing the Facebook Graph API.

First of all you must install the [[Facebook Python SDK https://github.com/facebook/python-sdk]].

Second, you need the following code in your model:

``
## import required modules
from facebook import GraphAPI
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.oauth20_account import OAuthAccount
## extend the OAUthAccount class
class FaceBookAccount(OAuthAccount):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;OAuth impl for Facebook&quot;&quot;&quot;
    AUTH_URL=&quot;https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize&quot;
    TOKEN_URL=&quot;https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token&quot;
    def __init__(self, g):
        OAuthAccount.__init__(self, g,
                              YOUR_CLIENT_ID,
                              YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET,
                              self.AUTH_URL,
                              self.TOKEN_URL)
        self.graph = None
    # override function that fetches user info
    def get_user(self):
        &quot;Returns the user using the Graph API&quot;
        if not self.accessToken():
            return None
        if not self.graph:
            self.graph = GraphAPI((self.accessToken()))
        try:
            user = self.graph.get_object(&quot;me&quot;)
            return dict(first_name = user[&#x27;first_name&#x27;],
                        last_name = user[&#x27;last_name&#x27;],
                        username = user[&#x27;id&#x27;])
        except GraphAPIError:
            self.session.token = None
            self.graph = None
            return None
## use the above class to build a new login form
auth.settings.login_form=FaceBookAccount()
``:code

##### LinkedIn
``LinkedIn``:inxx

We have previously discussed integration with Janrain (which has LinkedIn support) and that is the easiest way to use OAuth. Yet sometime you do not want to rely on a third party service or you may want to access LinkedIn directly to get more information than Janrain provides.

Here is an example:

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.linkedin_account import LinkedInAccount
auth.settings.login_form=LinkedInAccount(request,KEY,SECRET,RETURN_URL)
``:code

``LinkedInAccount`` requires the &quot;python-linkedin&quot; module installed separately.

##### X509

You can also login by passing to the page an x509 certificate and your credential will be extracted from the certificate. This requires ``M2Crypto`` installed from

``
http://chandlerproject.org/bin/view/Projects/MeTooCrypto
``

Once you have M2Cryption installed you can do:

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.x509_auth import X509Account
auth.settings.actions_disabled=[&#x27;register&#x27;,&#x27;change_password&#x27;,&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;]
auth.settings.login_form = X509Account()
``:code

You can now authenticate into web2py passing your x509 certificate. How to do this is browser-dependent, but probably you are more likely to use certificates for web services. In this case you can use for example ``cURL`` to try out your authentication:

``
curl -d &quot;firstName=John&amp;lastName=Smith&quot; -G -v --key private.key \
     --cert  server.crt https://example/app/default/user/profile
``

This works out of the box with Rocket (the web2py built-in web server) but you may need some extra configuration work on the web server side if you are using a different web server. In particular you need to tell your web server where the certificates are located on local host and that it needs to verify certificates coming from the clients. How to do it is web server dependent and therefore omitted here.

##### Multiple login forms

Some login methods modify the login_form, some do not. When they do that, they may not be able to coexist. Yet some coexist by providing multiple login forms in the same page. web2py provides a way to do it. Here is an example mixing normal login (auth) and RPX login (janrain.com):

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.extended_login_form import ExtendedLoginForm
other_form = RPXAccount(request, api_key=&#x27;...&#x27;, domain=&#x27;...&#x27;, url=&#x27;...&#x27;)
auth.settings.login_form = ExtendedLoginForm(auth, other_form, signals=[&#x27;token&#x27;])
``:code

If signals are set and a parameter in request matches any signals,
it will return the call of ``other_form.login_form`` instead.
``other_form`` can handle some particular situations, for example,
multiple steps of OpenID login inside ``other_form.login_form``.

Otherwise it will render the normal login form together with the ``other_form``.

#### Record versioning

You can use Auth to enable full record versioning:

``
db.enable_record_versioning(db,
    archive_db=None,
    archive_names=&#x27;%(tablename)s_archive&#x27;,
    current_record=&#x27;current_record&#x27;):
``:code

This tells web2py to create an archive table for each of the tables in ``db`` and store a copy of each record when modified. The old copy is stored. The new copy is not.

The last three parameters are optional:

- ``archive_db`` allows to specify another database where the archive tables are to be stored. Setting it to ``None`` is the same as setting it to ``db``.
- ``archive_names`` provides a pattern for naming each archive table.
- ``current_record`` specified the name of the reference field to be used in the archive table to refer to the original, unmodified, record. Notice that ``archive_db!=db`` then the reference field is just an integer field since cross database references are not possible.


Only tables with ``modified_by`` and ``modified_on`` fields (as created
for example by auth.signature) will be archived.

When you ``enable_record_versioning``, if records have an
``is_active`` field (also created by auth.signature),
records will never be deleted but they will be marked with ``is_active=False``.
In fact, ``enable_record_versioning`` adds a ``common_filter`` to
every versioned table that filters out records with ``is_active=False`` so they essentially become invisible.

If you ``enable_record_versioning``, you should not use
``auth.archive`` or ``crud.archive`` else you will end up with duplicate records.
Those functions do explicitly what ``enable_record_versioning`` does automatically and
they will be deprecated.


#### ``Mail`` and ``Auth``

One can define a mailer with

``
from gluon.tools import Mail
mail = Mail()
mail.settings.server = &#x27;smtp.example.com:25&#x27;
mail.settings.sender = &#x27;you@example.com&#x27;
mail.settings.login = &#x27;username:password&#x27;

``

or simply use the mailer provided by ``auth``:

``
mail = auth.settings.mailer
mail.settings.server = &#x27;smtp.example.com:25&#x27;
mail.settings.sender = &#x27;you@example.com&#x27;
mail.settings.login = &#x27;username:password&#x27;
``

You need to replace the mail.settings with the proper parameters for your SMTP server. Set ``mail.settings.login = None`` if the SMTP server does not require authentication.

You can read more about web2py API for emails and email configuration in Chapter 8. Here we limit the discussion to the interaction between ``Mail`` and ``Auth``.

In ``Auth``, by default, email verification is disabled.
To enable email, append the following lines in the model where ``auth`` is defined:

``
auth.settings.registration_requires_verification = True
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = False
auth.settings.reset_password_requires_verification = True
auth.messages.verify_email = &#x27;Click on the link http://&#x27; + \
    request.env.http_host + \
    URL(r=request,c=&#x27;default&#x27;,f=&#x27;user&#x27;,args=[&#x27;verify_email&#x27;]) + \
    &#x27;/%(key)s to verify your email&#x27;
auth.messages.reset_password = &#x27;Click on the link http://&#x27; + \
    request.env.http_host + \
    URL(r=request,c=&#x27;default&#x27;,f=&#x27;user&#x27;,args=[&#x27;reset_password&#x27;]) + \
    &#x27;/%(key)s to reset your password&#x27;
``:code

In the two ``auth.messages`` above, you may need to replace the URL portion of the string with the proper complete URL of the action. This is necessary because web2py may be installed behind a proxy, and it cannot determine its own public URLs with absolute certainty. The above examples (which are the default values) should, however, work in most cases.

### Authorization

Once a new user is registered, a new group is created to contain the user. The role of the new user is conventionally &quot;user_[id]&quot; where [id] is the id of the newly created user. The creation of the group can be disabled with
``
auth.settings.create_user_groups = None
``:code

although we do not suggest doing so. Notice that ``create_user_groups`` is not a boolean (althought it can be ``False``) but it defaults to:

``
auth.settings.create_user_groups=&quot;user_%(id)s&quot;
``:code

It store a template for the name of the group created for user ``id``.

Users have membership in groups. Each group is identified by a name/role. Groups have permissions. Users have permissions because of the groups they belong to. By default each user is made member of their own group.

You can also also do
``
auth.settings.everybody_group_id = 5
``:code

to make any new user automatically member of group number 5. Here 5 is used as an example and we assume the group was created already.

You can create groups, give membership and permissions via **appadmin**
or programmatically using the following methods:
``
auth.add_group(&#x27;role&#x27;, &#x27;description&#x27;)
``:code

returns the id of the newly created group.

``
auth.del_group(group_id)
``:code

deletes the group with ``group_id``.

``
auth.del_group(auth.id_group(&#x27;user_7&#x27;))
``:code

deletes the group with role &quot;user_7&quot;, i.e., the group uniquely associated to user number 7.

``
auth.user_group(user_id)
``:code

returns the id of the group uniquely associated to the user identified by ``user_id``.

``
auth.add_membership(group_id, user_id)
``:code

gives ``user_id`` membership of the group ``group_id``.
If the ``user_id`` is not specified, then web2py assumes the current logged-in user.

``
auth.del_membership(group_id, user_id)
``:code

revokes ``user_id`` membership of the group ``group_id``.
If the ``user_id`` is not specified, then web2py assumes the current logged-in user.

``
auth.has_membership(group_id, user_id, role)
``:code

checks whether ``user_id`` has membership of the group ``group_id`` or the group with the specified role. Only ``group_id`` or ``role`` should be passed to the function, not both. If the ``user_id`` is not specified, then web2py assumes the current logged-in user.

``
auth.add_permission(group_id, &#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;object&#x27;, record_id)
``:code

gives permission &quot;name&quot; (user defined) on the object &quot;object&quot; (also user defined) to members of the group ``group_id``. If &quot;object&quot; is a tablename then the permission can refer to the entire table by setting ``record_id`` to a value of zero, or the permission can refer to a specific record by specifying a ``record_id`` value greater than zero. When giving permissions on tables, it is common to use a permission name in the set (&#x27;create&#x27;, &#x27;read&#x27;, &#x27;update&#x27;, &#x27;delete&#x27;, &#x27;select&#x27;) since these permissions are understood and can be enforced by the CRUD APIs.

If ``group_id`` is zero, web2py uses the group uniquely associated to the current logged-in user.

You can also use ``auth.id_group(role=&quot;...&quot;)`` to get the id of a group given its name. ``id_group``:inxx

``
auth.del_permission(group_id, &#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;object&#x27;, record_id)
``:code

revokes the permission.

``
auth.has_permission(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;object&#x27;, record_id, user_id)
``:code

checks whether the user identified by ``user_id`` has membership in a group with the requested permission.

``
rows = db(auth.accessible_query(&#x27;read&#x27;, db.mytable, user_id))\
    .select(db.mytable.ALL)
``:code

returns all rows of table &quot;mytable&quot; that user ``user_id`` has &quot;read&quot; permission on.
If the ``user_id`` is not specified, then web2py assumes the current logged-in user.
The ``accessible_query(...)`` can be combined with other queries to make more complex ones.
``accessible_query(...)`` is the only **Auth** method to require a JOIN, so it does not work on the Google App Engine.

Assuming the following definitions:
``
&gt;&gt;&gt; from gluon.tools import Auth
&gt;&gt;&gt; auth = Auth(db)
&gt;&gt;&gt; auth.define_tables()
&gt;&gt;&gt; secrets = db.define_table(&#x27;document&#x27;, Field(&#x27;body&#x27;))
&gt;&gt;&gt; james_bond = db.auth_user.insert(first_name=&#x27;James&#x27;,
                                     last_name=&#x27;Bond&#x27;)
``:code

Here is an example:
``
&gt;&gt;&gt; doc_id = db.document.insert(body = &#x27;top secret&#x27;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; agents = auth.add_group(role = &#x27;Secret Agent&#x27;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; auth.add_membership(agents, james_bond)
&gt;&gt;&gt; auth.add_permission(agents, &#x27;read&#x27;, secrets)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print auth.has_permission(&#x27;read&#x27;, secrets, doc_id, james_bond)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; print auth.has_permission(&#x27;update&#x27;, secrets, doc_id, james_bond)
False
``:code

#### Decorators

The most common way to check permission is not by explicit calls to the above methods, but by decorating functions so that permissions are checked relative to the logged-in visitor. Here are some examples:
``
def function_one():
    return &#x27;this is a public function&#x27;

@auth.requires_login()
def function_two():
    return &#x27;this requires login&#x27;

@auth.requires_membership(&#x27;agents&#x27;)
def function_three():
    return &#x27;you are a secret agent&#x27;

@auth.requires_permission(&#x27;read&#x27;, secrets)
def function_four():
    return &#x27;you can read secret documents&#x27;

@auth.requires_permission(&#x27;delete&#x27;, &#x27;any file&#x27;)
def function_five():
    import os
    for file in os.listdir(&#x27;./&#x27;):
        os.unlink(file)
    return &#x27;all files deleted&#x27;

@auth.requires(auth.user_id==1 or request.client==&#x27;127.0.0.1&#x27;, requires_login=True)
def function_six():
    return &#x27;you can read secret documents&#x27;

@auth.requires_permission(&#x27;add&#x27;, &#x27;number&#x27;)
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def function_seven():
    return add(3, 4)
``:code

The condition argument of ``@auth.requires(condition)`` can be a callable and unless the condition is simple, it better to pass a callable than a condition since this will be faster, as the condition will only be evaluated if needed. For example

``
@auth.requires(lambda: check_condition())
def action():
    ....
``:code

``@auth.requires`` also takes an optional argument ``requires_login`` which defaults to ``True``. If set to False, it does not require login before evaluating the condition as true/false. The condition can be a boolean value or a function evaluating to boolean.

Note that access to all functions apart from the first one is restricted based on permissions that the visitor may or may not have.

If the visitor is not logged in, then the permission cannot be checked; the visitor is redirected to the login page and then back to the page that requires permissions.

#### Combining requirements

Occasionally, it is necessary to combine requirements. This can be done via a generic ``requires`` decorator which takes a single argument, a true or false condition. For example, to give access to agents, but only on Tuesday:
``
@auth.requires(auth.has_membership(group_id=agents) \
               and request.now.weekday()==1)
def function_seven():
    return &#x27;Hello agent, it must be Tuesday!&#x27;
``:code

or equivalently:
``
@auth.requires(auth.has_membership(role=&#x27;Secret Agent&#x27;) \
               and request.now.weekday()==1)
def function_seven():
    return &#x27;Hello agent, it must be Tuesday!&#x27;
``:code

#### Authorization and CRUD

Using decorators and/or explicit checks provides one way to implement access control.

Another way to implement access control is to always use CRUD (as opposed to ``SQLFORM``) to access the database and to ask CRUD to enforce access control on database tables and records. This is done by linking ``Auth`` and CRUD with the following statement:
``
crud.settings.auth = auth
``:code

This will prevent the visitor from accessing any of the CRUD functions unless the visitor is logged in and has explicit access. For example, to allow a visitor to post comments, but only update their own comments (assuming crud, auth and db.comment are defined):
``
def give_create_permission(form):
    group_id = auth.id_group(&#x27;user_%s&#x27; % auth.user.id)
    auth.add_permission(group_id, &#x27;read&#x27;, db.comment)
    auth.add_permission(group_id, &#x27;create&#x27;, db.comment)
    auth.add_permission(group_id, &#x27;select&#x27;, db.comment)

def give_update_permission(form):
    comment_id = form.vars.id
    group_id = auth.id_group(&#x27;user_%s&#x27; % auth.user.id)
    auth.add_permission(group_id, &#x27;update&#x27;, db.comment, comment_id)
    auth.add_permission(group_id, &#x27;delete&#x27;, db.comment, comment_id)

auth.settings.register_onaccept = give_create_permission
crud.settings.auth = auth

def post_comment():
   form = crud.create(db.comment, onaccept=give_update_permission)
   comments = db(db.comment).select()
   return dict(form=form, comments=comments)

def update_comment():
   form = crud.update(db.comment, request.args(0))
   return dict(form=form)
``:code

You can also select specific records (those you have &#x27;read&#x27; access to):
``
def post_comment():
   form = crud.create(db.comment, onaccept=give_update_permission)
   query = auth.accessible_query(&#x27;read&#x27;, db.comment, auth.user.id)
   comments = db(query).select(db.comment.ALL)
   return dict(form=form, comments=comments)
``:code

The permissions names enforced by :

``
crud.settings.auth = auth
``:code

are &quot;read&quot;, &quot;create&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;select&quot;, &quot;impersonate&quot;.

#### Authorization and downloads

The use of decorators and the use of ``crud.settings.auth`` do not enforce authorization on files downloaded by the usual download function
``
def download(): return response.download(request, db)
``:code

If one wishes to do so, one must declare explicitly which &quot;upload&quot; fields contain files that need access control upon download.
For example:
``
db.define_table(&#x27;dog&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;small_image&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;large_image&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;))

db.dog.large_image.authorization = lambda record: \
   auth.is_logged_in() and \
   auth.has_permission(&#x27;read&#x27;, db.dog, record.id, auth.user.id)
``:code

The attribute ``authorization`` of upload field can be None (the default) or a function that decides whether the user is logged in and has permission to &#x27;read&#x27; the current record. In this example, there is no restriction on downloading images linked by the &quot;small_image&quot; field, but we require access control on images linked by the &quot;large_image&quot; field.


#### Access Control and Basic Authentication

Occasionally, it may be necessary to expose actions that have decorators that require access control as services; i.e., to call them from a program or script and still be able to use authentication to check for authorization.

**Auth** enables login via basic authentication:
``
auth.settings.allow_basic_login = True
``:code

With this set, an action like
``
@auth.requires_login()
def give_me_time():
    import time
    return time.ctime()
``:code

can be called, for example, from a shell command:
``
wget --user=[username] --password=[password]
    http://.../[app]/[controller]/give_me_time
``:code

It is also possible to log in by calling ``auth.basic()`` rather than using an ``@auth`` decorator:
``
def give_me_time():
    import time
    auth.basic()
    if auth.user:
        return time.ctime()
    else:
        return &#x27;Not authorized&#x27;
``:code

Basic login is often the only option for services (described in the next chapter), but it is disabled by default.

#### Manual Authentication

Some times you want to implement your own logic and do &quot;manual&quot; user login.
This can also be done by calling the function:

``
user = auth.login_bare(username,password)
``:code

``login_bare`` returns user if the user exists and the password is valid, else it returns False. ``username`` is the email if the &quot;auth_user&quot; table does not have a &quot;username&quot; field.

#### Settings and messages

Here is a list of all parameters that can be customized for **Auth**

The following must point to a ``gluon.tools.Mail`` object to allow ``auth`` to send emails:

``
auth.settings.mailer = None
``:code

The following must be the name of the controller that defined the ``user`` action:

``
auth.settings.controller = &#x27;default&#x27;
``:code

The following is a very important setting:

``
auth.settings.hmac_key = None
``:code

It must be set to something like &quot;sha512:a-pass-phrase&quot; and it will be passed to the CRYPT validator for the &quot;password&quot; field of the ``auth_user`` table. It will be the algorithm and a-pass-phrase used to hash the passwords.

By default, auth also requires a minimum password length of 4. This can be changed:
``
auth.settings.password_min_length = 4
``:code

To disabled an action append its name to this list:
``
auth.settings.actions_disabled = []
``:code

For example:

``
auth.settings.actions_disabled.append(&#x27;register&#x27;)
``:code

will disable registration.

If you want to receive an email to verify registration set this to ``True``:

``
auth.settings.registration_requires_verification = False
``:code

To automatically login people after registration, even if they have not completed the email verification process, set the following to ``True``:

``
auth.settings.login_after_registration = False
``:code

If new registrants must wait for approval before being able to login set this to ``True``:

``
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = False
``:code

Approval consists of setting ``registration_key==&#x27;&#x27;`` via appadmin or programmatically.

If you do not want a new group for each new user set the following to ``False``:

``
auth.settings.create_user_groups = True
``:code

The following settings determine alternative login methods and login forms, as discussed previously:

``
auth.settings.login_methods = [auth]
auth.settings.login_form = auth
``:code

Do you want to allow basic login?

``
auth.settings.allows_basic_login = False
``:code


The following is the URL of the ``login`` action:

``
auth.settings.login_url = URL(&#x27;user&#x27;, args=&#x27;login&#x27;)
``:code

If the user tried to access the register page but is already logged in, he will be redirected to this URL:

``
auth.settings.logged_url = URL(&#x27;user&#x27;, args=&#x27;profile&#x27;)
``:code

This must point to the URL of the download action, in case the profile contains images:

``
auth.settings.download_url = URL(&#x27;download&#x27;)
``:code

These must point to the URL you want to redirect your users to after the various possible ``auth`` actions (in case there is no referrer):

``
auth.settings.login_next = URL(&#x27;index&#x27;)
auth.settings.logout_next = URL(&#x27;index&#x27;)
auth.settings.profile_next = URL(&#x27;index&#x27;)
auth.settings.register_next = URL(&#x27;user&#x27;, args=&#x27;login&#x27;)
auth.settings.retrieve_username_next = URL(&#x27;index&#x27;)
auth.settings.retrieve_password_next = URL(&#x27;index&#x27;)
auth.settings.change_password_next = URL(&#x27;index&#x27;)
auth.settings.request_reset_password_next = URL(&#x27;user&#x27;, args=&#x27;login&#x27;)
auth.settings.reset_password_next = URL(&#x27;user&#x27;, args=&#x27;login&#x27;)
auth.settings.verify_email_next = URL(&#x27;user&#x27;, args=&#x27;login&#x27;)
``:code

If the visitor is not logger in, and calls a function that requires authentication,
the user is redirected to ``auth.settings.login_url`` which defaults to ``URL(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;user/login&#x27;)``.
One can replace this behavior by redefining:
``on_failed_authentication``:inxx

``
auth.settings.on_failed_authentication = lambda url: redirect(url)
``:code

This is the function called for the redirection. The argument ``url``` passed to this function is the url for the login page.

If the visitor does not have permission to access a given function, the visitor is redirect to the URL defined by
``on_failed_authorization``:inxx

``
auth.settings.on_failed_authorization = \
    URL(&#x27;user&#x27;,args=&#x27;on_failed_authorization&#x27;)
``:code

You can change this variable and redirect the user elsewhere.

Often ``on_failed_authorization`` is a URL but it can be a function that returns the URL and it will be called on failed authorization.

These are lists of callbacks that should be executed after form validation for each of the corresponding action before any database IO:

``
auth.settings.login_onvalidation = []
auth.settings.register_onvalidation = []
auth.settings.profile_onvalidation = []
auth.settings.retrieve_password_onvalidation = []
auth.settings.reset_password_onvalidation = []
``:code

Each callback must be a function that takes the ``form`` object and it can modify the attributes of the form object before database IO is performed.

These are lists of callbacks that should be executed after the database IO is performed and before redirection:

``
auth.settings.login_onaccept = []
auth.settings.register_onaccept = []
auth.settings.profile_onaccept = []
auth.settings.verify_email_onaccept = []
``:code

Here is an example:

``
auth.settings.register_onaccept.append(lambda form:\
   mail.send(to=&#x27;you@example.com&#x27;,subject=&#x27;new user&#x27;,
             message=&#x27;new user email is %s&#x27;%form.vars.email))
``:code

You can enable captcha for any of the ``auth`` actions:

``
auth.settings.captcha = None
auth.settings.login_captcha = None
auth.settings.register_captcha = None
auth.settings.retrieve_username_captcha = None
auth.settings.retrieve_password_captcha = None
``:code

If the ``.captcha`` settings points to a ``gluon.tools.Recaptcha``, all forms for which the corresponding option (like ``.login_captcha``) is set to ``None`` will have a captcha, while those for which the corresponding option is set to ``False`` will not. If, instead, ``.captcha`` is set to ``None``, only those form who have a corresponding option set to a ``gluon.tools.Recaptcha`` object will have captcha and the others will not.

This is the login session expiration time:

``
auth.settings.expiration = 3600  # seconds
``:code

You can change the name of the password field (in Firebird for example &quot;password&quot; is a keyword and cannot be used to name a field):

``
auth.settings.password_field = &#x27;password&#x27;
``:code


Normally the login form tries to validate an email. This can be disabled by changing this setting:

``
auth.settings.login_email_validate = True
``:code

Do you want to show the record id in the edit profile page?

``
auth.settings.showid = False
``:code

For custom forms you may want to disable automatic error notification in forms:

``
auth.settings.hideerror = False
``:code

Also for custom forms you can change the style:

``
auth.settings.formstyle = &#x27;table3cols&#x27;
``:code

(it can be &quot;table2cols&quot;, &quot;divs&quot; and &quot;ul&quot;)

And you can set the separator for auth-generated forms:

``
auth.settings.label_separator =        &#x27;:&#x27;
``:code


By default the login form gives the option to extend the login via &quot;remember me&quot; option. The expiration time can be changed or the option disabled via these settings:

``
auth.settings.long_expiration = 3600*24*30 # one month
auth.settings.remember_me_form = True
``:code

You can also customize the following messages whose use and context should be obvious:
``
auth.messages.submit_button = &#x27;Submit&#x27;
auth.messages.verify_password = &#x27;Verify Password&#x27;
auth.messages.delete_label = &#x27;Check to delete:&#x27;

### Central Authentication Service
``CAS``:inxx ``authentication``:inxx

web2py provides support for third party authentication and single sign on.
Here we discuss the Central Authentication Service (CAS) which is an industry standard and both client and server are built-into web2py.

CAS is an open protocol for distributed authentication and it works in the following way: When a visitor arrives at our web site, our application check in the session if the user is already authenticated (for example via a ``session.token`` object). If the user is not authenticated, the controller redirects the visitor from the CAS appliance, where the user can log in, register, and manage his credentials (name, email and password). If the user registers, he receives an email, and registration is not complete until he responds to the email. Once the user has successfully registered and logged in, the CAS appliance redirects the user to our application together with a key. Our application uses the key to get the credentials of the user via an HTTP request in the background to the CAS server.

Using this mechanism, multiple applications can use a single sign-on via a single CAS server. The server providing authentication is called a service provider. Applications seeking to authenticate visitors are called service consumers.

CAS is similar to OpenID, with one main difference. In the case of OpenID, the visitor chooses the service provider. In the case of CAS, our application makes this choice, making CAS more secure.

Running a web2py CAS provider is as easy as copying the scaffolding app. In fact any web2py app that exposes the action

``
## in provider app
def user(): return dict(form=auth())
``

is a CAS 2.0 provider and its services can be accessed at the URL

``
http://.../provider/default/user/cas/login
http://.../provider/default/user/cas/validate
http://.../provider/default/user/cas/logout
``:code
(we assume the app to be called &quot;provider&quot;).

You can access this service from any other web application (the consumer) by simply delegating authentication to the provider:

``
## in consumer app
auth = Auth(db,cas_provider = &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/provider/default/user/cas&#x27;)
``:code

When you visit the login url the consumer app, it will redirect you to the provider app which will perform authentication and will redirect back to the consumer. All processes of registration, logout, change password, retrieve password, have to be completed on the provider app. An entry about the logged-in user will be created on the consumer side so that you add extra fields and have a local profile. Thanks to CAS 2.0 all fields that are readable on the provider and have a corresponding field in the ``auth_user`` table of the consumer will be copied automatically.

``Auth(...,cas_provider=&#x27;...&#x27;)`` works with third party providers and supports CAS 1.0 and 2.0. The version is detected automatically. By default it builds the URLs of the provider from a base (the ``cas_provider`` url above) by appending

``
/login
/validate
/logout
``:code

These can be changed in consumer and in provider

``
## in consumer or provider app (must match)
auth.settings.cas_actions[&#x27;login&#x27;]=&#x27;login&#x27;
auth.settings.cas_actions[&#x27;validate&#x27;]=&#x27;validate&#x27;
auth.settings.cas_actions[&#x27;logout&#x27;]=&#x27;logout&#x27;
``

If you want to connect to a web2py CAS provider from a different domain, you must enable them by attending to the list of allowed domain:

``
## in provider app
auth.settings.cas_domains.append(&#x27;example.com&#x27;)
``:code


#### Using web2py to authorize non-web2py apps

This is possible but dependent on the web server.
here we assume two applications running under the same web server: Apache with ``mod_wsgi``.
One of the applications is web2py with an app proving access control via Auth.
The other can be a CGI script, a PHP program or anything else.
We want to instruct the web server to ask permission to the former application when a client requests access to the latter.

First of all we need to modify the web2py application and add the following controller:

``
def check_access():
    return &#x27;true&#x27; if auth.is_logged_in() else &#x27;false&#x27;
``:code

which returns ``true`` if the user is logged in and ``false`` otherwise. Now run a web2py process in background:

``
nohup python web2py.py -a &#x27;&#x27; -p 8002
``

Port 8002 is a must and there is no need to enable admin so no admin password.

Then we need to edit the Apache config file (for example &quot;/etc/apache2/sites-available/default&quot;) and instruct apache so that when the non-web2py program is called, it should call the above ``check`` action instead and only if it returns ``true`` it should proceed and respond to the request, else if should deny access.

Because web2py and the non-web2py application run under the same domain, if the user is logged into the web2py app, the web2py session cookie will be passed to Apache even when the other app is requested and will allow credential verification.

In order to achieve this we need a script, &quot;web2py/scripts/access.wsgi&quot; that can play this trick.
The script ships with web2py. All we need to do it tell apache to call this script, the URL of the application needing access control, and the location of the script:

``
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
   WSGIDaemonProcess web2py user=www-data group=www-data
   WSGIProcessGroup web2py
   WSGIScriptAlias / /home/www-data/web2py/wsgihandler.py

   AliasMatch ^myapp/path/needing/authentication/myfile /path/to/myfile
   &lt;Directory /path/to/&gt;
     WSGIAccessScript /path/to/web2py/scripts/access.wsgi
   &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
``

Here &quot;^myapp/path/needing/authentication/myfile&quot; is the regular expression that should match the incoming request and &quot;/path/to/&quot; is the absolute location of the web2py folder.

The &quot;access.wsgi&quot; script contains the following line:

``
URL_CHECK_ACCESS = &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8002/%(app)s/default/check_access&#x27;
``

which points to the web2py application we have requested but you can edit it to point to a specific application, running on a port other than 8002.

You can also change the ``check_access()`` action and make its logic more complex. This action can retrieve the URL that was originally requested using the environment variable

``
request.env.request_uri
``

and you can implement more complex rules:

``
def check_access():
    if not auth.is_logged_in():
       return &#x27;false&#x27;
    elif not user_has_access(request.env.request_uri):
       return &#x27;false&#x27;
    else:
       return &#x27;true&#x27;
``:code
</pre></div>
    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #F2DEDE;">## Access Control
``Auth``:inxx ``Access Control``:inxx ``RBAC``:inxx ``DAC``:inxx ``MAC``:inxx

web2py includes a powerful and customizable Role Based Access Control mechanism (RBAC).

Here is a definition from Wikipedia:

&quot;Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is a newer alternative approach to mandatory access control (MAC) and discretionary access control (DAC). RBAC is sometimes referred to as role-based security.

RBAC is a policy neutral and flexible access control technology sufficiently powerful to simulate DAC and MAC. Conversely, MAC can simulate RBAC if the role graph is restricted to a tree rather than a partially ordered set.

Prior to the development of RBAC, MAC and DAC were considered to be the only known models for access control: if a model was not MAC, it was considered to be a DAC model, and vice versa. Research in the late 1990s demonstrated that RBAC falls in neither category.

Within an organization, roles are created for various job functions. The permissions to perform certain operations are assigned to specific roles. Members of staff (or other system users) are assigned particular roles, and through those role assignments acquire the permissions to perform particular system functions. Unlike context-based access control (CBAC), RBAC does not look at the message context (such as a connection&#x27;s source).

Since users are not assigned permissions directly, but only acquire them through their role (or roles), management of individual user rights becomes a matter of simply assigning appropriate roles to the user; this simplifies common operations, such as adding a user, or changing a user&#x27;s department.

RBAC differs from access control lists (ACLs) used in traditional discretionary access control systems in that it assigns permissions to specific operations with meaning in the organization, rather than to low level data objects. For example, an access control list could be used to grant or deny write access to a particular system file, but it would not dictate how that file could be changed.&quot;

The web2py class that implements RBAC is called **Auth**.

**Auth** needs (and defines) the following tables:
- ``auth_user`` stores users&#x27; name, email address, password, and status (registration pending, accepted, blocked)
- ``auth_group`` stores groups or roles for users in a many-to-many structure. By default, each user is in its own group, but a user can be in multiple groups, and each group can contain multiple users. A group is identified by a role and a description.
- ``auth_membership`` links users and groups in a many-to-many structure.
- ``auth_permission`` links groups and permissions. A permission is identified by a name and, optionally, a table and a record. For example, members of a certain group can have &quot;update&quot; permissions on a specific record of a specific table.
- ``auth_event`` logs changes in the other tables and successful access via CRUD to objects controlled by the RBAC.

In principle, there is no restriction on the names of the roles and the names of the permissions; the developer can create them to fix the roles and permissions in the organization. Once they have been created, web2py provides an API to check if a user is logged in, if a user is a member of a given group, and/or if the user is a member of any group that has a given required permission.

web2py also provides decorators to restrict access to any function based on login, membership and permissions.

web2py also understands some specific permissions, i.e., those that have a name that correspond to the CRUD methods (create, read, update, delete) and can enforce them automatically without the need to use decorators.

In this chapter, we are going to discuss different parts of RBAC one by one.

### Authentication

In order to use RBAC, users need to be identified. This means that they need to register (or be registered) and log in.

**Auth** provides multiple login methods. The default one consists of identifying users based on the local ``auth_user`` table.
Alternatively, it can log in users against third-party authentication systems and single sign on providers such as Google, PAM, LDAP, Facebook, LinkedIn, Dropbox, OpenID, OAuth, etc..

To start using ``Auth``, you need at least this code in a model file, which is also provided with the web2py &quot;welcome&quot; application and assumes a ``db`` connection object:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
``:code

Auth has an optional ``secure=True`` argument, which will force authenticated pages to go over HTTPS. ``https``:inxx

The ``password`` field of the ``db.auth_user`` table defaults to a ``CRYPT`` validator, which needs and ``hmac_key``. On legacy web2py applications you may see an extra argument passed to the Auth constructor: ``hmac_key = Auth.get_or_create_key()``. The latter is a function that read the hmac kay from a file &quot;private/auth.key&quot; within the application folder. If the file does not exist it creates a random ``hmac_key``. If multiple apps share the same auth database, make sure they also use the same ``hmac_key``. This is no loger necessary for new applications since passwords are salted with an individual random salt.

By default, web2py uses email for login. If instead you want to log in using username set ``auth.define_tables(username=True)``

If multiple apps share the same auth database you may want to disable migrations: ``auth.define_tables(migrate=False)``.

To expose **Auth**, you also need the following function in a controller (for example in &quot;default.py&quot;):
``
def user(): return dict(form=auth())
``:code

The ``auth`` object and the ``user`` action are already defined in the
scaffolding application.

web2py also includes a sample view &quot;welcome/views/default/user.html&quot; to render this function properly that looks like this:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;{{=T( request.args(0).replace(&#x27;_&#x27;,&#x27; &#x27;).capitalize() )}}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;web2py_user_form&quot;&gt;
  {{=form}}
  {{if request.args(0)==&#x27;login&#x27;:}}
    {{if not &#x27;register&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;register&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
    {{if not &#x27;request_reset_password&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;lost password&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
  {{pass}}
&lt;/div&gt;
``:code

Notice that this function simply displays a ``form`` and therefore it can be customized using normal custom form syntax. The only caveat is that the form displayed by ``form=auth()`` depends on ``request.args(0)``; therefore, if you replace the default ``auth()`` login form with a custom login form, you may need an ``if`` statement like this in the view:
``
{{if request.args(0)==&#x27;login&#x27;:}}...custom login form...{{pass}}
``:code

``auth.impersonate``:inxx ``auth.is_impersonating``:inxx

The controller above exposes multiple actions:
``
http://.../[app]/default/user/register
http://.../[app]/default/user/login
http://.../[app]/default/user/logout
http://.../[app]/default/user/profile
http://.../[app]/default/user/change_password
http://.../[app]/default/user/verify_email
http://.../[app]/default/user/retrieve_username
http://.../[app]/default/user/request_reset_password
http://.../[app]/default/user/reset_password
http://.../[app]/default/user/impersonate
http://.../[app]/default/user/groups
http://.../[app]/default/user/not_authorized
``:code
- **register** allows users to register. It is integrated with CAPTCHA, although this is disabled by default. This is also integrated with a client-side entropy calculator defined in &quot;web2py.js&quot;. The calculator indictates the strenght of the new password. You can use the ``IS_STRONG`` validator to prevent web2py from accepting weak passwords. 
- **login** allows users who are registered to log in (if the registration is verified or does not require verification, if it has been approved or does not require approval, and if it has not been blocked).
- **logout** does what you would expect but also, as the other methods, logs the event and can be used to trigger some event.
- **profile** allows users to edit their profile, i.e. the content of the ``auth_user`` table. Notice that this table does not have a fixed structure and can be customized.
- **change_password** allows users to change their password in a fail-safe way.
- **verify_email**. If email verification is turned on, then visitors, upon registration, receive an email with a link to verify their email information. The link points to this action.
- **retrieve_username**. By default, **Auth** uses email and password for login, but it can, optionally, use username instead of email. In this latter case, if a user forgets his/her username, the ``retrieve_username`` method allows the user to type the email address and retrieve the username by email.
- **request_reset_password**. Allows users who forgot their password to request a new password. They will get a confirmation email pointing to **reset_password**.
- **impersonate** allows a user to &quot;impersonate&quot; another user. This is important for debugging and for support purposes. ``request.args[0]`` is the id of the user to be impersonated. This is only allowed if the logged in user ``has_permission(&#x27;impersonate&#x27;, db.auth_user, user_id)``. You can use ``auth.is_impersonating()`` to check is the current user is impersonating somebody else.
- **groups** lists the groups of which the current logged in user is a member.
- **not_authorized** displays an error message when the visitor tried to do something that he/she is not authorized to do
- **navbar** is a helper that generates a bar with login/register/etc. links.

Logout, profile, change_password, impersonate, and groups require login.

By default they are all exposed, but it is possible to restrict access to only some of these actions.

All of the methods above can be extended or replaced by subclassing **Auth**.

All of the methods above can be used in separate actions. For example:

``
def mylogin(): return dict(form=auth.login())
def myregister(): return dict(form=auth.register())
def myprofile(): return dict(form=auth.profile())
...
``

To restrict access to functions to only logged in visitors, decorate the function as in the following example
``
@auth.requires_login()
def hello():
    return dict(message=&#x27;hello %(first_name)s&#x27; % auth.user)
``:code

Any function can be decorated, not just exposed actions. Of course this is still only a very simple example of access control. More complex examples will be discussed later.
``auth.user``:inxx ``auth.user_id``:inxx ``auth.user_groups``.

``auth.user`` contains a copy of the ``db.auth_user`` records for the current logged in user or ``None`` otherwise. There is also a ``auth.user_id`` which is the same as ``auth.user.id`` (i.e. the id of the current logger in user) or ``None``. Similarly, ``auth.user_groups`` contains a dictionary where each key is the id of a group of with the current logged in user is member of, the value is the corresponding group role.

``otherwise``:inxx

The ``auth.requires_login()`` decorator as well as the other ``auth.requires_*`` decorators take an optional ``otherwise`` argument. It can be set to a string where to redirect the user if registration files or to a callable object. It is called if registration fails.

#### Restrictions on registration

If you want to allow visitors to register but not to log in until registration has been approved by the administrator:
``
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = True
``:code

You can approve a registration via the appadmin interface. Look into the table ``auth_user``. Pending registrations have a ``registration_key`` field set to &quot;pending&quot;. A registration is approved when this field is set to blank.

Via the appadmin interface, you can also block a user from logging in. Locate the user in the table ``auth_user`` and set the ``registration_key`` to &quot;blocked&quot;. &quot;blocked&quot; users are not allowed to log in. Notice that this will prevent a visitor from logging in but it will not force a visitor who is already logged in to log out. The word &quot;disabled&quot; may be used instead of &quot;blocked&quot; if preferred, with exactly the same behavior.

You can also block access to the &quot;register&quot; page completely with this statement:
``
auth.settings.actions_disabled.append(&#x27;register&#x27;)
``:code

If you want to allow people to register and automatically log them in after registration but still want to send an email for verification so that they cannot login again after logout, unless they completed the instructions in the email, you can accomplish it as follows:

``
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = True
auth.settings.login_after_registration = True
``:code


Other methods of **Auth** can be restricted in the same way.

#### Integration with OpenID, Facebook, etc.
``Janrain``:inxx ``OpenID``:inxx ``Facebook``:inxx ``LinkedIn``:inxx ``Google``:inxx ``MySpace``:inxx ``Flickr``:inxx

You can use the web2py Role Base Access Control and authenticate with other services like OpenID, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, Dropbox, MySpace, Flickr, etc.
The easiest way is to use Janrain Engage (formerly RPX) (Janrain.com).

Dropbox is discussed as a special case in Chapter 14 since it allows more than just login, it also provides storage services for the logged in users.

Janrain Engage is a service that provides middleware authentication. You can register with Janrain.com, register a domain (the name of your app) and set of URLs you will be using, and they will provide you with an API key.

Now edit the model of your web2py application and place the following lines somewhere after the definition of the ``auth`` object :

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.rpx_account import RPXAccount
auth.settings.actions_disabled=[&#x27;register&#x27;,&#x27;change_password&#x27;,&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;]
auth.settings.login_form = RPXAccount(request,
    api_key=&#x27;...&#x27;,
    domain=&#x27;...&#x27;,
    url = &quot;http://localhost:8000/%s/default/user/login&quot; % request.application)
``:code

The first line imports the new login method, the second line disables local registration, and the third line asks web2py to use the RPX login method. You must insert your own ``api_key`` provided by Janrain.com, the domain you choose upon registration and the external ``url`` of your login page.

[[image @///image/en6900.png center 300px]]

When a new user logins for the first time, web2py creates a new ``db.auth_user`` record associated to the user. It will use the ``registration_id`` field to store a unique id for the user. Most authentication methods will also provide a username, email, first_name and last_name but that is not guaranteed. Which fields are provided depends on the login method selected by the user. If the same user logs in twice using different authentication mechanisms (for example once with OpenID and once with Facebook), Janrain may not recognize his/her as the same user and issue different ``registration_id``.

You can customize the mapping between the data provided by Janrain and the data stored in ``db.auth_user``. Here is an example for Facebook:
``
auth.settings.login_form.mappings.Facebook = lambda profile:\
            dict(registration_id = profile[&quot;identifier&quot;],
                 username = profile[&quot;preferredUsername&quot;],
                 email = profile[&quot;email&quot;],
                 first_name = profile[&quot;name&quot;][&quot;givenName&quot;],
                 last_name = profile[&quot;name&quot;][&quot;familyName&quot;])
``:code

The keys in the dictionary are fields in ``db.auth_user`` and the values are data entries in the profile object provided by Janrain. Look at the online Janrain documentation for details on the latter.

Janrain will also keep statistics about your users&#x27; login.

This login form is fully integrated with web2py Role Based Access Control and you can still create groups, make users members of groups, assign permissions, block users, etc.

Janrain&#x27;s free Basic service allows up to 2500 unique registered users to sign in annually. Accommodating more users requires an upgrade to one of their paid service tiers.

If you prefer not to use Janrain and want to use a different login method (LDAP, PAM, Google, OpenID, OAuth/Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) you can do so. The API to do so is described later in the chapter.

#### CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA

``CAPTCHA``:inxx ``reCAPTCHA``:inxx ``PIL``:inxx
To prevent spammers and bots registering on your site, you may require a registration CAPTCHA. web2py supports reCAPTCHA``recaptcha``:cite  out of the box. This is because reCAPTCHA is very well designed, free, accessible (it can read the words to the visitors), easy to set up, and does not require installing any third-party libraries.

This is what you need to do to use reCAPTCHA:
- Register with reCAPTCHA``recaptcha``:cite  and obtain a (PUBLIC_KEY, PRIVATE_KEY) couple for your account. These are just two strings.
- Append the following code to your model after the ``auth`` object is defined:
``
from gluon.tools import Recaptcha
auth.settings.captcha = Recaptcha(request,
    &#x27;PUBLIC_KEY&#x27;, &#x27;PRIVATE_KEY&#x27;)
``:code

reCAPTCHA may not work if you access the web site as &#x27;localhost&#x27; or &#x27;127.0.0.1&#x27;, because it is registered to work with publicly visible web sites only.

The ``Recaptcha`` constructor takes some optional arguments:
``
Recaptcha(..., use_ssl=True, error_message=&#x27;invalid&#x27;, label=&#x27;Verify:&#x27;, options=&#x27;&#x27;)
``:code

Notice that ``use_ssl=False`` by default.

``options`` may be a configuration string, e.g. ``options=&quot;theme:&#x27;white&#x27;, lang:&#x27;fr&#x27;&quot;``

More details: [[reCAPTCHA http://www.google.com/recaptcha]]``recaptchagoogle``:cite  and [[customizing http://code.google.com/apis/recaptcha/docs/customization.html]]  .

If you do not want to use reCAPTCHA, look into the definition of the ``Recaptcha`` class in &quot;gluon/tools.py&quot;, since it is easy to use other CAPTCHA systems.

Notice that ``Recaptcha`` is just a helper that extends ``DIV``. It generates a dummy field that validates using the ``reCaptcha`` service and, therefore, it can be used in any form, including used defined FORMs:

``
form = FORM(INPUT(...),Recaptcha(...),INPUT(_type=&#x27;submit&#x27;))
``:code

You can use it in all types of SQLFORM by injection:

``
form = SQLFORM(...) or SQLFORM.factory(...)
form.element(&#x27;table&#x27;).insert(-1,TR(&#x27;&#x27;,Recaptcha(...),&#x27;&#x27;))
``:code

#### Customizing ``Auth``

The call to
``
auth.define_tables()
``:code

defines all **Auth** tables that have not been defined already. This means that if you wish to do so, you can define your own ``auth_user`` table.

There are a number of ways to customize auth. The simplest way is to add extra fields:

``
## after auth = Auth(db)
auth.settings.extra_fields[&#x27;auth_user&#x27;]= [
  Field(&#x27;address&#x27;),
  Field(&#x27;city&#x27;),
  Field(&#x27;zip&#x27;),
  Field(&#x27;phone&#x27;)]
## before auth.define_tables(username=True)
``

You can declare extra fields not just for table &quot;auth_user&quot; but also for other &quot;auth_&quot; tables.
Using ``extra_fields`` is the recommended way as it will not break any internal mechanism.

Another way to do this, although not really recommended, consists of defining your auth tables yourself. If a table is declared before ``auth.define_tables()`` it is used instead of the default one. Here is how to do it:

``
## after auth = Auth(db)
db.define_table(
    auth.settings.table_user_name,
    Field(&#x27;first_name&#x27;, length=128, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;last_name&#x27;, length=128, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;email&#x27;, length=128, default=&#x27;&#x27;, unique=True), # required
    Field(&#x27;password&#x27;, &#x27;password&#x27;, length=512,            # required
          readable=False, label=&#x27;Password&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;address&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;city&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;zip&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;phone&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;registration_key&#x27;, length=512,                # required
          writable=False, readable=False, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;reset_password_key&#x27;, length=512,              # required
          writable=False, readable=False, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;registration_id&#x27;, length=512,                 # required
          writable=False, readable=False, default=&#x27;&#x27;))

## do not forget validators
custom_auth_table = db[auth.settings.table_user_name] # get the custom_auth_table
custom_auth_table.first_name.requires = \
  IS_NOT_EMPTY(error_message=auth.messages.is_empty)
custom_auth_table.last_name.requires = \
  IS_NOT_EMPTY(error_message=auth.messages.is_empty)
custom_auth_table.password.requires = [IS_STRONG(), CRYPT()]
custom_auth_table.email.requires = [
  IS_EMAIL(error_message=auth.messages.invalid_email),
  IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, custom_auth_table.email)]

auth.settings.table_user = custom_auth_table # tell auth to use custom_auth_table

## before auth.define_tables()
``:code

You can add any field you wish, and you can change validators but you cannot remove
the fields marked as &quot;required&quot; in this example.

It is important to make &quot;password&quot;, &quot;registration_key&quot;, &quot;reset_password_key&quot; and &quot;registration_id&quot; fields ``readable=False`` and ``writable=False``, since a visitor must not be allowed to tamper with them.

If you add a field called &quot;username&quot;, it will be used in place of &quot;email&quot; for login. If you do, you will need to add a validator as well:
``
auth_table.username.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, auth_table.username)
``:code

#### Renaming ``Auth`` tables

The actual names of the ``Auth`` tables are stored in
``
auth.settings.table_user_name = &#x27;auth_user&#x27;
auth.settings.table_group_name = &#x27;auth_group&#x27;
auth.settings.table_membership_name = &#x27;auth_membership&#x27;
auth.settings.table_permission_name = &#x27;auth_permission&#x27;
auth.settings.table_event_name = &#x27;auth_event&#x27;
``:code

The names of the table can be changed by reassigning the above variables after the ``auth`` object is defined and before the Auth tables are defined. For example:
``
auth = Auth(db)
auth.settings.table_user_name = &#x27;person&#x27;
#...
auth.define_tables()
``:code

The actual tables can also be referenced, independently of their actual names, by
``
auth.settings.table_user
auth.settings.table_group
auth.settings.table_membership
auth.settings.table_permission
auth.settings.table_event
``:code

#### Other login methods and login forms
``LDAP``:inxx ``PAM``:inxx

Auth provides multiple login methods and hooks to create new login methods. Each supported login method corresponds to a file in the folder
``
gluon/contrib/login_methods/
``:code

Refer to the documentation in the files themselves for each login method, but here are some examples.

First of all, we need to make a distinction between two types of alternate login methods:
- login methods that use a web2py login form (although the credentials are verified outside web2py). An example is LDAP.
- login methods that require an external single-sign-on form (an example is Google and Facebook).

In the latter case, web2py never gets the login credentials, only a login token issued by the service provider. The token is stored in ``db.auth_user.registration_id``.

Let&#x27;s consider examples of the first case:

##### Basic

Let&#x27;s say you have an authentication service, for example at the url

``
https://basic.example.com
``:code

that accepts basic access authentication. That means the server accepts HTTP requests with a header of the form:

``
GET /index.html HTTP/1.0
Host: basic.example.com
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
``:code

where the latter string is the base64 encoding of the string username:password. The service responds 200 OK if the user is authorized and 400, 401, 402, 403 or 404 otherwise.

You want to enter username and password using the standard ``Auth`` login form and verify the credentials against such a service. All you need to do is add the following code to your application
``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.basic_auth import basic_auth
auth.settings.login_methods.append(
    basic_auth(&#x27;https://basic.example.com&#x27;))
``:code

Notice that ``auth.settings.login_methods`` is a list of authentication methods that are executed sequentially.
By default it is set to
``
auth.settings.login_methods = [auth]
``:code

When an alternate method is appended, for example ``basic_auth``, **Auth** first tries to log in the visitor based on the content of ``auth_user``, and when this fails, it tries the next method in the list. If a method succeeds in logging in the visitor, and if ``auth.settings.login_methods[0]==auth``, ``Auth`` takes the following actions:
- if the user does not exist in ``auth_user``, a new user is created and the username/email and passwords are stored.
- if the user does exist in ``auth_user`` but the new accepted password does not match the old stored password, the old password is replaced with the new one (notice that passwords are always stored hashed unless specified otherwise).

If you do not wish to store the new password in ``auth_user``, then it is sufficient to change the order of login methods, or remove ``auth`` from the list. For example:
``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.basic_auth import basic_auth
auth.settings.login_methods = \
    [basic_auth(&#x27;https://basic.example.com&#x27;)]
``:code

The same applies for any other login method described here.

##### SMTP and Gmail
``SMTP``:inxx ``Gmail``:inxx

You can verify login credentials using a remote SMTP server, for example Gmail; i.e., you log the user in if the email and password they provide are valid credentials to access the Gmail SMTP server (``smtp.gmail.com:587``). All that is needed is the following code:
``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.email_auth import email_auth
auth.settings.login_methods.append(
    email_auth(&quot;smtp.gmail.com:587&quot;, &quot;@gmail.com&quot;))
``:code

The first argument of ``email_auth`` is the address:port of the SMTP server. The second argument is the email domain.

This works with any SMTP server that requires TLS authentication.``TLS``:inxx

##### PAM
``PAM``:inxx

Authentication using Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) works as in the previous cases. It allows web2py to authenticate users using the operating system accounts:
``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.pam_auth import pam_auth
auth.settings.login_methods.append(pam_auth())
``:code

##### LDAP
``LDAP``:inxx

Authentication using LDAP works very much as in the previous cases.

To use LDAP login with MS Active Directory:``Active Directory``:inxx
``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.ldap_auth import ldap_auth
auth.settings.login_methods.append(ldap_auth(mode=&#x27;ad&#x27;,
   server=&#x27;my.domain.controller&#x27;,
   base_dn=&#x27;ou=Users,dc=domain,dc=com&#x27;))
``:code

To use LDAP login with Lotus Notes and Domino:``Lotus Notes``:inxx ``Domino``:inxx
``
auth.settings.login_methods.append(ldap_auth(mode=&#x27;domino&#x27;,
   server=&#x27;my.domino.server&#x27;))
``:code

To use LDAP login with OpenLDAP (with UID):``OpenLDAP``:inxx
``
auth.settings.login_methods.append(ldap_auth(server=&#x27;my.ldap.server&#x27;,
   base_dn=&#x27;ou=Users,dc=domain,dc=com&#x27;))
``:code

To use LDAP login with OpenLDAP (with CN):
``
auth.settings.login_methods.append(ldap_auth(mode=&#x27;cn&#x27;,
   server=&#x27;my.ldap.server&#x27;, base_dn=&#x27;ou=Users,dc=domain,dc=com&#x27;))
``:code

##### Google App Engine
``GAE login``:inxx

Authentication using Google when running on Google App Engine requires skipping the web2py login form, being redirected to the Google login page, and back upon success. Because the behavior is different than in the previous examples, the API is a little different.

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.gae_google_login import GaeGoogleAccount
auth.settings.login_form = GaeGoogleAccount()
``:code

##### OpenID
``OpenID``:inxx

We have previously discussed integration with Janrain (which has OpenID support) and that is the easiest way to use OpenID. Yet sometimes you do not want to rely on a third party service and you want to access the OpenID provider directly from the consumer (your app).

Here is an example:

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.openid_auth import OpenIDAuth
auth.settings.login_form = OpenIDAuth(auth)
``:code

``OpenIDAuth`` requires the &#x27;&#x27;python-openid&#x27;&#x27; module to be installed separately. Under the hood, this login method defines the following table:

``
db.define_table(&#x27;alt_logins&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;username&#x27;, length=512, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;type&#x27;, length =128, default=&#x27;openid&#x27;, readable=False),
    Field(&#x27;user&#x27;, self.table_user, readable=False))
``:code

which stores the openid usernames for each user. If you want to display the openids for the current logged in user:

``
{{=auth.settings.login_form.list_user_openids()}}
``:code

##### OAuth2.0 and Facebook
``OAuth``:inxx ``Facebook``:inxx

We have previously discussed integration with Janrain (which has Facebook support), yet sometimes you do not want to rely on a third party service and you want to access a OAuth2.0 provider directly; for example, Facebook. Here is how:

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.oauth20_account import OAuthAccount
auth.settings.login_form=OAuthAccount(YOUR_CLIENT_ID,YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET)
``:code

Things get a little more complex if you want to use Facebook OAuth2.0 to login into a specific Facebook app to access its API, instead of your own app. Here is an example for accessing the Facebook Graph API.

First of all you must install the [[Facebook Python SDK https://github.com/facebook/python-sdk]].

Second, you need the following code in your model:

``
## import required modules
from facebook import GraphAPI
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.oauth20_account import OAuthAccount
## extend the OAUthAccount class
class FaceBookAccount(OAuthAccount):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;OAuth impl for Facebook&quot;&quot;&quot;
    AUTH_URL=&quot;https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize&quot;
    TOKEN_URL=&quot;https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token&quot;
    def __init__(self, g):
        OAuthAccount.__init__(self, g,
                              YOUR_CLIENT_ID,
                              YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET,
                              self.AUTH_URL,
                              self.TOKEN_URL)
        self.graph = None
    # override function that fetches user info
    def get_user(self):
        &quot;Returns the user using the Graph API&quot;
        if not self.accessToken():
            return None
        if not self.graph:
            self.graph = GraphAPI((self.accessToken()))
        try:
            user = self.graph.get_object(&quot;me&quot;)
            return dict(first_name = user[&#x27;first_name&#x27;],
                        last_name = user[&#x27;last_name&#x27;],
                        username = user[&#x27;id&#x27;])
        except GraphAPIError:
            self.session.token = None
            self.graph = None
            return None
## use the above class to build a new login form
auth.settings.login_form=FaceBookAccount()
``:code

##### LinkedIn
``LinkedIn``:inxx

We have previously discussed integration with Janrain (which has LinkedIn support) and that is the easiest way to use OAuth. Yet sometime you do not want to rely on a third party service or you may want to access LinkedIn directly to get more information than Janrain provides.

Here is an example:

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.linkedin_account import LinkedInAccount
auth.settings.login_form=LinkedInAccount(request,KEY,SECRET,RETURN_URL)
``:code

``LinkedInAccount`` requires the &quot;python-linkedin&quot; module installed separately.

##### X509

You can also login by passing to the page an x509 certificate and your credential will be extracted from the certificate. This requires ``M2Crypto`` installed from

``
http://chandlerproject.org/bin/view/Projects/MeTooCrypto
``

Once you have M2Cryption installed you can do:

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.x509_auth import X509Account
auth.settings.actions_disabled=[&#x27;register&#x27;,&#x27;change_password&#x27;,&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;]
auth.settings.login_form = X509Account()
``:code

You can now authenticate into web2py passing your x509 certificate. How to do this is browser-dependent, but probably you are more likely to use certificates for web services. In this case you can use for example ``cURL`` to try out your authentication:

``
curl -d &quot;firstName=John&amp;lastName=Smith&quot; -G -v --key private.key \
     --cert  server.crt https://example/app/default/user/profile
``

This works out of the box with Rocket (the web2py built-in web server) but you may need some extra configuration work on the web server side if you are using a different web server. In particular you need to tell your web server where the certificates are located on local host and that it needs to verify certificates coming from the clients. How to do it is web server dependent and therefore omitted here.

##### Multiple login forms

Some login methods modify the login_form, some do not. When they do that, they may not be able to coexist. Yet some coexist by providing multiple login forms in the same page. web2py provides a way to do it. Here is an example mixing normal login (auth) and RPX login (janrain.com):

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.extended_login_form import ExtendedLoginForm
other_form = RPXAccount(request, api_key=&#x27;...&#x27;, domain=&#x27;...&#x27;, url=&#x27;...&#x27;)
auth.settings.login_form = ExtendedLoginForm(auth, other_form, signals=[&#x27;token&#x27;])
``:code

If signals are set and a parameter in request matches any signals,
it will return the call of ``other_form.login_form`` instead.
``other_form`` can handle some particular situations, for example,
multiple steps of OpenID login inside ``other_form.login_form``.

Otherwise it will render the normal login form together with the ``other_form``.

#### Record versioning

You can use Auth to enable full record versioning:

``
db.enable_record_versioning(db,
    archive_db=None,
    archive_names=&#x27;%(tablename)s_archive&#x27;,
    current_record=&#x27;current_record&#x27;):
``:code

This tells web2py to create an archive table for each of the tables in ``db`` and store a copy of each record when modified. The old copy is stored. The new copy is not.

The last three parameters are optional:

- ``archive_db`` allows to specify another database where the archive tables are to be stored. Setting it to ``None`` is the same as setting it to ``db``.
- ``archive_names`` provides a pattern for naming each archive table.
- ``current_record`` specified the name of the reference field to be used in the archive table to refer to the original, unmodified, record. Notice that ``archive_db!=db`` then the reference field is just an integer field since cross database references are not possible.


Only tables with ``modified_by`` and ``modified_on`` fields (as created
for example by auth.signature) will be archived.

When you ``enable_record_versioning``, if records have an 
``is_active`` field (also created by auth.signature), 
records will never be deleted but they will be marked with ``is_active=False``.
In fact, ``enable_record_versioning`` adds a ``common_filter`` to 
every versioned table that filters out records with ``is_active=False`` so they essentially become invisible.

If you ``enable_record_versioning``, you should not use 
``auth.archive`` or ``crud.archive`` else you will end up with duplicate records.
Those functions do explicitly what ``enable_record_versioning`` does automatically and
they will be deprecated.


#### ``Mail`` and ``Auth``

One can define a mailer with

``
from gluon.tools import Mail
mail = Mail()
mail.settings.server = &#x27;smtp.example.com:25&#x27;
mail.settings.sender = &#x27;you@example.com&#x27;
mail.settings.login = &#x27;username:password&#x27;

``

or simply use the mailer provided by ``auth``:

``
mail = auth.settings.mailer
mail.settings.server = &#x27;smtp.example.com:25&#x27;
mail.settings.sender = &#x27;you@example.com&#x27;
mail.settings.login = &#x27;username:password&#x27;
``

You need to replace the mail.settings with the proper parameters for your SMTP server. Set ``mail.settings.login = None`` if the SMTP server does not require authentication.

You can read more about web2py API for emails and email configuration in Chapter 8. Here we limit the discussion to the interaction between ``Mail`` and ``Auth``.

In ``Auth``, by default, email verification is disabled.
To enable email, append the following lines in the model where ``auth`` is defined:

``
auth.settings.registration_requires_verification = True
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = False
auth.settings.reset_password_requires_verification = True
auth.messages.verify_email = &#x27;Click on the link http://&#x27; + \
    request.env.http_host + \
    URL(r=request,c=&#x27;default&#x27;,f=&#x27;user&#x27;,args=[&#x27;verify_email&#x27;]) + \
    &#x27;/%(key)s to verify your email&#x27;
auth.messages.reset_password = &#x27;Click on the link http://&#x27; + \
    request.env.http_host + \
    URL(r=request,c=&#x27;default&#x27;,f=&#x27;user&#x27;,args=[&#x27;reset_password&#x27;]) + \
    &#x27;/%(key)s to reset your password&#x27;
``:code

In the two ``auth.messages`` above, you may need to replace the URL portion of the string with the proper complete URL of the action. This is necessary because web2py may be installed behind a proxy, and it cannot determine its own public URLs with absolute certainty. The above examples (which are the default values) should, however, work in most cases.

### Authorization

Once a new user is registered, a new group is created to contain the user. The role of the new user is conventionally &quot;user_[id]&quot; where [id] is the id of the newly created user. The creation of the group can be disabled with
``
auth.settings.create_user_groups = None
``:code

although we do not suggest doing so. Notice that ``create_user_groups`` is not a boolean (althought it can be ``False``) but it defaults to:

``
auth.settings.create_user_groups=&quot;user_%(id)s&quot;
``:code

It store a template for the name of the group created for user ``id``.

Users have membership in groups. Each group is identified by a name/role. Groups have permissions. Users have permissions because of the groups they belong to. By default each user is made member of their own group.

You can also also do
``
auth.settings.everybody_group_id = 5
``:code

to make any new user automatically member of group number 5. Here 5 is used as an example and we assume the group was created already.

You can create groups, give membership and permissions via **appadmin**
or programmatically using the following methods:
``
auth.add_group(&#x27;role&#x27;, &#x27;description&#x27;)
``:code

returns the id of the newly created group.

``
auth.del_group(group_id)
``:code

deletes the group with ``group_id``.

``
auth.del_group(auth.id_group(&#x27;user_7&#x27;))
``:code

deletes the group with role &quot;user_7&quot;, i.e., the group uniquely associated to user number 7.

``
auth.user_group(user_id)
``:code

returns the id of the group uniquely associated to the user identified by ``user_id``.

``
auth.add_membership(group_id, user_id)
``:code

gives ``user_id`` membership of the group ``group_id``.
If the ``user_id`` is not specified, then web2py assumes the current logged-in user.

``
auth.del_membership(group_id, user_id)
``:code

revokes ``user_id`` membership of the group ``group_id``.
If the ``user_id`` is not specified, then web2py assumes the current logged-in user.

``
auth.has_membership(group_id, user_id, role)
``:code

checks whether ``user_id`` has membership of the group ``group_id`` or the group with the specified role. Only ``group_id`` or ``role`` should be passed to the function, not both. If the ``user_id`` is not specified, then web2py assumes the current logged-in user.

``
auth.add_permission(group_id, &#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;object&#x27;, record_id)
``:code

gives permission &quot;name&quot; (user defined) on the object &quot;object&quot; (also user defined) to members of the group ``group_id``. If &quot;object&quot; is a tablename then the permission can refer to the entire table by setting ``record_id`` to a value of zero, or the permission can refer to a specific record by specifying a ``record_id`` value greater than zero. When giving permissions on tables, it is common to use a permission name in the set (&#x27;create&#x27;, &#x27;read&#x27;, &#x27;update&#x27;, &#x27;delete&#x27;, &#x27;select&#x27;) since these permissions are understood and can be enforced by the CRUD APIs.

If ``group_id`` is zero, web2py uses the group uniquely associated to the current logged-in user.

You can also use ``auth.id_group(role=&quot;...&quot;)`` to get the id of a group given its name. ``id_group``:inxx

``
auth.del_permission(group_id, &#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;object&#x27;, record_id)
``:code

revokes the permission.

``
auth.has_permission(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;object&#x27;, record_id, user_id)
``:code

checks whether the user identified by ``user_id`` has membership in a group with the requested permission.

``
rows = db(auth.accessible_query(&#x27;read&#x27;, db.mytable, user_id))\
    .select(db.mytable.ALL)
``:code

returns all rows of table &quot;mytable&quot; that user ``user_id`` has &quot;read&quot; permission on.
If the ``user_id`` is not specified, then web2py assumes the current logged-in user.
The ``accessible_query(...)`` can be combined with other queries to make more complex ones.
``accessible_query(...)`` is the only **Auth** method to require a JOIN, so it does not work on the Google App Engine.

Assuming the following definitions:
``
&gt;&gt;&gt; from gluon.tools import Auth
&gt;&gt;&gt; auth = Auth(db)
&gt;&gt;&gt; auth.define_tables()
&gt;&gt;&gt; secrets = db.define_table(&#x27;document&#x27;, Field(&#x27;body&#x27;))
&gt;&gt;&gt; james_bond = db.auth_user.insert(first_name=&#x27;James&#x27;,
                                     last_name=&#x27;Bond&#x27;)
``:code

Here is an example:
``
&gt;&gt;&gt; doc_id = db.document.insert(body = &#x27;top secret&#x27;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; agents = auth.add_group(role = &#x27;Secret Agent&#x27;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; auth.add_membership(agents, james_bond)
&gt;&gt;&gt; auth.add_permission(agents, &#x27;read&#x27;, secrets)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print auth.has_permission(&#x27;read&#x27;, secrets, doc_id, james_bond)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; print auth.has_permission(&#x27;update&#x27;, secrets, doc_id, james_bond)
False
``:code

#### Decorators

The most common way to check permission is not by explicit calls to the above methods, but by decorating functions so that permissions are checked relative to the logged-in visitor. Here are some examples:
``
def function_one():
    return &#x27;this is a public function&#x27;

@auth.requires_login()
def function_two():
    return &#x27;this requires login&#x27;

@auth.requires_membership(&#x27;agents&#x27;)
def function_three():
    return &#x27;you are a secret agent&#x27;

@auth.requires_permission(&#x27;read&#x27;, secrets)
def function_four():
    return &#x27;you can read secret documents&#x27;

@auth.requires_permission(&#x27;delete&#x27;, &#x27;any file&#x27;)
def function_five():
    import os
    for file in os.listdir(&#x27;./&#x27;):
        os.unlink(file)
    return &#x27;all files deleted&#x27;

@auth.requires(auth.user_id==1 or request.client==&#x27;127.0.0.1&#x27;, requires_login=True)
def function_six():
    return &#x27;you can read secret documents&#x27;

@auth.requires_permission(&#x27;add&#x27;, &#x27;number&#x27;)
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def function_seven():
    return add(3, 4)
``:code

The condition argument of ``@auth.requires(condition)`` can be a callable and unless the condition is simple, it better to pass a callable than a condition since this will be faster, as the condition will only be evaluated if needed. For example

``
@auth.requires(lambda: check_condition())
def action():
    ....
``:code

``@auth.requires`` also takes an optional argument ``requires_login`` which defaults to ``True``. If set to False, it does not require login before evaluating the condition as true/false. The condition can be a boolean value or a function evaluating to boolean.

Note that access to all functions apart from the first one is restricted based on permissions that the visitor may or may not have.

If the visitor is not logged in, then the permission cannot be checked; the visitor is redirected to the login page and then back to the page that requires permissions.

#### Combining requirements

Occasionally, it is necessary to combine requirements. This can be done via a generic ``requires`` decorator which takes a single argument, a true or false condition. For example, to give access to agents, but only on Tuesday:
``
@auth.requires(auth.has_membership(group_id=agents) \
               and request.now.weekday()==1)
def function_seven():
    return &#x27;Hello agent, it must be Tuesday!&#x27;
``:code

or equivalently:
``

#### Authorization and CRUD

Using decorators and/or explicit checks provides one way to implement access control.

Another way to implement access control is to always use CRUD (as opposed to ``SQLFORM``) to access the database and to ask CRUD to enforce access control on database tables and records. This is done by linking ``Auth`` and CRUD with the following statement:
``
crud.settings.auth = auth
``:code

This will prevent the visitor from accessing any of the CRUD functions unless the visitor is logged in and has explicit access. For example, to allow a visitor to post comments, but only update their own comments (assuming crud, auth and db.comment are defined):
``
def give_create_permission(form):
    group_id = auth.id_group(&#x27;user_%s&#x27; % auth.user.id)
    auth.add_permission(group_id, &#x27;read&#x27;, db.comment)
    auth.add_permission(group_id, &#x27;create&#x27;, db.comment)
    auth.add_permission(group_id, &#x27;select&#x27;, db.comment)

def give_update_permission(form):
    comment_id = form.vars.id
    group_id = auth.id_group(&#x27;user_%s&#x27; % auth.user.id)
    auth.add_permission(group_id, &#x27;update&#x27;, db.comment, comment_id)
    auth.add_permission(group_id, &#x27;delete&#x27;, db.comment, comment_id)

auth.settings.register_onaccept = give_create_permission
crud.settings.auth = auth

def post_comment():
   form = crud.create(db.comment, onaccept=give_update_permission)
   comments = db(db.comment).select()
   return dict(form=form, comments=comments)

def update_comment():
   form = crud.update(db.comment, request.args(0))
   return dict(form=form)
``:code

You can also select specific records (those you have &#x27;read&#x27; access to):
``
def post_comment():
   form = crud.create(db.comment, onaccept=give_update_permission)
   query = auth.accessible_query(&#x27;read&#x27;, db.comment, auth.user.id)
   comments = db(query).select(db.comment.ALL)
   return dict(form=form, comments=comments)
``:code

The permissions names enforced by :

``
crud.settings.auth = auth
``:code

are &quot;read&quot;, &quot;create&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;select&quot;, &quot;impersonate&quot;.

#### Authorization and downloads

The use of decorators and the use of ``crud.settings.auth`` do not enforce authorization on files downloaded by the usual download function
``
def download(): return response.download(request, db)
``:code

If one wishes to do so, one must declare explicitly which &quot;upload&quot; fields contain files that need access control upon download.
For example:
``
db.define_table(&#x27;dog&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;small_image&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;large_image&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;))

db.dog.large_image.authorization = lambda record: \
   auth.is_logged_in() and \
   auth.has_permission(&#x27;read&#x27;, db.dog, record.id, auth.user.id)
``:code

The attribute ``authorization`` of upload field can be None (the default) or a function that decides whether the user is logged in and has permission to &#x27;read&#x27; the current record. In this example, there is no restriction on downloading images linked by the &quot;small_image&quot; field, but we require access control on images linked by the &quot;large_image&quot; field.


#### Access Control and Basic Authentication

Occasionally, it may be necessary to expose actions that have decorators that require access control as services; i.e., to call them from a program or script and still be able to use authentication to check for authorization.

**Auth** enables login via basic authentication:
``
auth.settings.allow_basic_login = True
``:code

With this set, an action like
``
@auth.requires_login()
def give_me_time():
    import time
    return time.ctime()
``:code

can be called, for example, from a shell command:
``
wget --user=[username] --password=[password]
    http://.../[app]/[controller]/give_me_time
``:code

It is also possible to log in by calling ``auth.basic()`` rather than using an ``@auth`` decorator:
``
def give_me_time():
    import time
    auth.basic()
    if auth.user:
        return time.ctime()
    else:
        return &#x27;Not authorized&#x27;
``:code

Basic login is often the only option for services (described in the next chapter), but it is disabled by default.

#### Manual Authentication

Some times you want to implement your own logic and do &quot;manual&quot; user login.
This can also be done by calling the function:

``
user = auth.login_bare(username,password)
``:code

``login_bare`` returns user if the user exists and the password is valid, else it returns False. ``username`` is the email if the &quot;auth_user&quot; table does not have a &quot;username&quot; field.

#### Settings and messages

Here is a list of all parameters that can be customized for **Auth**

The following must point to a ``gluon.tools.Mail`` object to allow ``auth`` to send emails:

``
auth.settings.mailer = None
``:code

The following must be the name of the controller that defined the ``user`` action:

``
auth.settings.controller = &#x27;default&#x27;
``:code

The following is a very important setting:

``
auth.settings.hmac_key = None
``:code

It must be set to something like &quot;sha512:a-pass-phrase&quot; and it will be passed to the CRYPT validator for the &quot;password&quot; field of the ``auth_user`` table. It will be the algorithm and a-pass-phrase used to hash the passwords.

By default, auth also requires a minimum password length of 4. This can be changed:
``
auth.settings.password_min_length = 4
``:code

To disabled an action append its name to this list:
``
auth.settings.actions_disabled = []
``:code

For example:

``
auth.settings.actions_disabled.append(&#x27;register&#x27;)
``:code

will disable registration.

If you want to receive an email to verify registration set this to ``True``:

``
auth.settings.registration_requires_verification = False
``:code

To automatically login people after registration, even if they have not completed the email verification process, set the following to ``True``:

``
auth.settings.login_after_registration = False
``:code

If new registrants must wait for approval before being able to login set this to ``True``:

``
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = False
``:code

Approval consists of setting ``registration_key==&#x27;&#x27;`` via appadmin or programmatically.

If you do not want a new group for each new user set the following to ``False``:

``
auth.settings.create_user_groups = True
``:code

The following settings determine alternative login methods and login forms, as discussed previously:

``
auth.settings.login_methods = [auth]
auth.settings.login_form = auth
``:code

Do you want to allow basic login?

``
auth.settings.allows_basic_login = False
``:code


The following is the URL of the ``login`` action:

``
auth.settings.login_url = URL(&#x27;user&#x27;, args=&#x27;login&#x27;)
``:code

If the user tried to access the register page but is already logged in, he will be redirected to this URL:

``
auth.settings.logged_url = URL(&#x27;user&#x27;, args=&#x27;profile&#x27;)
``:code

This must point to the URL of the download action, in case the profile contains images:

``
auth.settings.download_url = URL(&#x27;download&#x27;)
``:code

These must point to the URL you want to redirect your users to after the various possible ``auth`` actions (in case there is no referrer):

``
auth.settings.login_next = URL(&#x27;index&#x27;)
auth.settings.logout_next = URL(&#x27;index&#x27;)
auth.settings.profile_next = URL(&#x27;index&#x27;)
auth.settings.register_next = URL(&#x27;user&#x27;, args=&#x27;login&#x27;)
auth.settings.retrieve_username_next = URL(&#x27;index&#x27;)
auth.settings.retrieve_password_next = URL(&#x27;index&#x27;)
auth.settings.change_password_next = URL(&#x27;index&#x27;)
auth.settings.request_reset_password_next = URL(&#x27;user&#x27;, args=&#x27;login&#x27;)
auth.settings.reset_password_next = URL(&#x27;user&#x27;, args=&#x27;login&#x27;)
auth.settings.verify_email_next = URL(&#x27;user&#x27;, args=&#x27;login&#x27;)
``:code

If the visitor is not logger in, and calls a function that requires authentication,
the user is redirected to ``auth.settings.login_url`` which defaults to ``URL(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;user/login&#x27;)``.
One can replace this behavior by redefining:
``on_failed_authentication``:inxx

``
auth.settings.on_failed_authentication = lambda url: redirect(url)
``:code

This is the function called for the redirection. The argument ``url``` passed to this function is the url for the login page.

If the visitor does not have permission to access a given function, the visitor is redirect to the URL defined by
``on_failed_authorization``:inxx

``
auth.settings.on_failed_authorization = \
    URL(&#x27;user&#x27;,args=&#x27;on_failed_authorization&#x27;)
``:code

You can change this variable and redirect the user elsewhere.

Often ``on_failed_authorization`` is a URL but it can be a function that returns the URL and it will be called on failed authorization.

These are lists of callbacks that should be executed after form validation for each of the corresponding action before any database IO:

``
auth.settings.login_onvalidation = []
auth.settings.register_onvalidation = []
auth.settings.profile_onvalidation = []
auth.settings.retrieve_password_onvalidation = []
auth.settings.reset_password_onvalidation = []
``:code

Each callback must be a function that takes the ``form`` object and it can modify the attributes of the form object before database IO is performed.

These are lists of callbacks that should be executed after the database IO is performed and before redirection:

``
auth.settings.login_onaccept = []
auth.settings.register_onaccept = []
auth.settings.profile_onaccept = []
auth.settings.verify_email_onaccept = []
``:code

Here is an example:

``
auth.settings.register_onaccept.append(lambda form:\
   mail.send(to=&#x27;you@example.com&#x27;,subject=&#x27;new user&#x27;,
             message=&#x27;new user email is %s&#x27;%form.vars.email))
``:code

You can enable captcha for any of the ``auth`` actions:

``
auth.settings.captcha = None
auth.settings.login_captcha = None
auth.settings.register_captcha = None
auth.settings.retrieve_username_captcha = None
auth.settings.retrieve_password_captcha = None
``:code

If the ``.captcha`` settings points to a ``gluon.tools.Recaptcha``, all forms for which the corresponding option (like ``.login_captcha``) is set to ``None`` will have a captcha, while those for which the corresponding option is set to ``False`` will not. If, instead, ``.captcha`` is set to ``None``, only those form who have a corresponding option set to a ``gluon.tools.Recaptcha`` object will have captcha and the others will not.

This is the login session expiration time:

``
auth.settings.expiration = 3600  # seconds
``:code

You can change the name of the password field (in Firebird for example &quot;password&quot; is a keyword and cannot be used to name a field):

``
auth.settings.password_field = &#x27;password&#x27;
``:code


Normally the login form tries to validate an email. This can be disabled by changing this setting:

``
auth.settings.login_email_validate = True
``:code

Do you want to show the record id in the edit profile page?

``
auth.settings.showid = False
``:code

For custom forms you may want to disable automatic error notification in forms:

``
auth.settings.hideerror = False
``:code

Also for custom forms you can change the style:

``
auth.settings.formstyle = &#x27;table3cols&#x27;
``:code

(it can be &quot;table2cols&quot;, &quot;divs&quot; and &quot;ul&quot;)

And you can set the separator for auth-generated forms:

``
auth.settings.label_separator =	&#x27;:&#x27;
``:code


By default the login form gives the option to extend the login via &quot;remember me&quot; option. The expiration time can be changed or the option disabled via these settings:

``
auth.settings.long_expiration = 3600*24*30 # one month
auth.settings.remember_me_form = True
``:code

You can also customize the following messages whose use and context should be obvious:
``
auth.messages.submit_button = &#x27;Submit&#x27;
auth.messages.verify_password = &#x27;Verify Password&#x27;
auth.messages.delete_label = &#x27;Check to delete:&#x27;

### Central Authentication Service
``CAS``:inxx ``authentication``:inxx

web2py provides support for third party authentication and single sign on.
Here we discuss the Central Authentication Service (CAS) which is an industry standard and both client and server are built-into web2py.

CAS is an open protocol for distributed authentication and it works in the following way: When a visitor arrives at our web site, our application check in the session if the user is already authenticated (for example via a ``session.token`` object). If the user is not authenticated, the controller redirects the visitor from the CAS appliance, where the user can log in, register, and manage his credentials (name, email and password). If the user registers, he receives an email, and registration is not complete until he responds to the email. Once the user has successfully registered and logged in, the CAS appliance redirects the user to our application together with a key. Our application uses the key to get the credentials of the user via an HTTP request in the background to the CAS server.

Using this mechanism, multiple applications can use a single sign-on via a single CAS server. The server providing authentication is called a service provider. Applications seeking to authenticate visitors are called service consumers.

CAS is similar to OpenID, with one main difference. In the case of OpenID, the visitor chooses the service provider. In the case of CAS, our application makes this choice, making CAS more secure.

Running a web2py CAS provider is as easy as copying the scaffolding app. In fact any web2py app that exposes the action

``
## in provider app
def user(): return dict(form=auth())
``

is a CAS 2.0 provider and its services can be accessed at the URL

``
http://.../provider/default/user/cas/login
http://.../provider/default/user/cas/validate
http://.../provider/default/user/cas/logout
``:code
(we assume the app to be called &quot;provider&quot;).

You can access this service from any other web application (the consumer) by simply delegating authentication to the provider:

``
## in consumer app
auth = Auth(db,cas_provider = &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/provider/default/user/cas&#x27;)
``:code

When you visit the login url the consumer app, it will redirect you to the provider app which will perform authentication and will redirect back to the consumer. All processes of registration, logout, change password, retrieve password, have to be completed on the provider app. An entry about the logged-in user will be created on the consumer side so that you add extra fields and have a local profile. Thanks to CAS 2.0 all fields that are readable on the provider and have a corresponding field in the ``auth_user`` table of the consumer will be copied automatically.

``Auth(...,cas_provider=&#x27;...&#x27;)`` works with third party providers and supports CAS 1.0 and 2.0. The version is detected automatically. By default it builds the URLs of the provider from a base (the ``cas_provider`` url above) by appending

``
/login
/validate
/logout
``:code

These can be changed in consumer and in provider

``
## in consumer or provider app (must match)
auth.settings.cas_actions[&#x27;login&#x27;]=&#x27;login&#x27;
auth.settings.cas_actions[&#x27;validate&#x27;]=&#x27;validate&#x27;
auth.settings.cas_actions[&#x27;logout&#x27;]=&#x27;logout&#x27;
``

If you want to connect to a web2py CAS provider from a different domain, you must enable them by attending to the list of allowed domain:

``
## in provider app
auth.settings.cas_domains.append(&#x27;example.com&#x27;)
``:code


#### Using web2py to authorize non-web2py apps

This is possible but dependent on the web server.
here we assume two applications running under the same web server: Apache with ``mod_wsgi``.
One of the applications is web2py with an app proving access control via Auth.
The other can be a CGI script, a PHP program or anything else.
We want to instruct the web server to ask permission to the former application when a client requests access to the latter.

First of all we need to modify the web2py application and add the following controller:

``
def check_access():
    return &#x27;true&#x27; if auth.is_logged_in() else &#x27;false&#x27;
``:code

which returns ``true`` if the user is logged in and ``false`` otherwise. Now run a web2py process in background:

``
nohup python web2py.py -a &#x27;&#x27; -p 8002
``

Port 8002 is a must and there is no need to enable admin so no admin password.

Then we need to edit the Apache config file (for example &quot;/etc/apache2/sites-available/default&quot;) and instruct apache so that when the non-web2py program is called, it should call the above ``check`` action instead and only if it returns ``true`` it should proceed and respond to the request, else if should deny access.

Because web2py and the non-web2py application run under the same domain, if the user is logged into the web2py app, the web2py session cookie will be passed to Apache even when the other app is requested and will allow credential verification.

In order to achieve this we need a script, &quot;web2py/scripts/access.wsgi&quot; that can play this trick.
The script ships with web2py. All we need to do it tell apache to call this script, the URL of the application needing access control, and the location of the script:

``
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
   WSGIDaemonProcess web2py user=www-data group=www-data
   WSGIProcessGroup web2py
   WSGIScriptAlias / /home/www-data/web2py/wsgihandler.py

   AliasMatch ^myapp/path/needing/authentication/myfile /path/to/myfile
   &lt;Directory /path/to/&gt;
     WSGIAccessScript /path/to/web2py/scripts/access.wsgi
   &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
``

Here &quot;^myapp/path/needing/authentication/myfile&quot; is the regular expression that should match the incoming request and &quot;/path/to/&quot; is the absolute location of the web2py folder.

The &quot;access.wsgi&quot; script contains the following line:

``
URL_CHECK_ACCESS = &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8002/%(app)s/default/check_access&#x27;
``

which points to the web2py application we have requested but you can edit it to point to a specific application, running on a port other than 8002.

You can also change the ``check_access()`` action and make its logic more complex. This action can retrieve the URL that was originally requested using the environment variable

``
request.env.request_uri
``

and you can implement more complex rules:

``
def check_access():
    if not auth.is_logged_in():
       return &#x27;false&#x27;
    elif not user_has_access(request.env.request_uri):
       return &#x27;false&#x27;
    else:
       return &#x27;true&#x27;
``:code

-------
The ``password`` field of the ``db.auth_user`` table defaults to a ``CRYPT`` validator, which needs and ``hmac_key``. On legacy web2py applications you may see an extra argument passed to the Auth constructor: ``hmac_key = Auth.get_or_create_key()``. The latter is a function that read the hmac kay from a file &quot;private/auth.key&quot; within the application folder. If the file does not exist it creates a random ``hmac_key``. If multiple apps share the same auth database, make sure they also use the same ``hmac_key``. This is no loger necessary for new applications since passwords are salted with an individual random salt.
-------

By default, web2py uses email for login. If instead you want to log in using username set ``auth.define_tables(username=True)``

If multiple apps share the same auth database you may want to disable migrations: ``auth.define_tables(migrate=False)``.

To expose **Auth**, you also need the following function in a controller (for example in &quot;default.py&quot;):
``
def user(): return dict(form=auth())
``:code

The ``auth`` object and the ``user`` action are already defined in the
scaffolding application.
-------

web2py also includes a sample view &quot;welcome/views/default/user.html&quot; to render this function properly that looks like this:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;{{=T( request.args(0).replace(&#x27;_&#x27;,&#x27; &#x27;).capitalize() )}}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;web2py_user_form&quot;&gt;
  {{=form}}
  {{if request.args(0)==&#x27;login&#x27;:}}
    {{if not &#x27;register&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;register&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
    {{if not &#x27;request_reset_password&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;lost password&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
  {{pass}}
&lt;/div&gt;
``:code

Notice that this function simply displays a ``form`` and therefore it can be customized using normal custom form syntax. The only caveat is that the form displayed by ``form=auth()`` depends on ``request.args(0)``; therefore, if you replace the default ``auth()`` login form with a custom login form, you may need an ``if`` statement like this in the view:
``
{{if request.args(0)==&#x27;login&#x27;:}}...custom login form...{{pass}}
``:code

``auth.impersonate``:inxx ``auth.is_impersonating``:inxx

The controller above exposes multiple actions:
``
http://.../[app]/default/user/register
http://.../[app]/default/user/login
http://.../[app]/default/user/logout
http://.../[app]/default/user/profile
http://.../[app]/default/user/change_password
http://.../[app]/default/user/verify_email
http://.../[app]/default/user/retrieve_username
http://.../[app]/default/user/request_reset_password
http://.../[app]/default/user/reset_password
http://.../[app]/default/user/impersonate
http://.../[app]/default/user/groups
http://.../[app]/default/user/not_authorized
``:code
- **register** allows users to register. It is integrated with CAPTCHA, although this is disabled by default.
- **login** allows users who are registered to log in (if the registration is verified or does not require verification, if it has been approved or does not require approval, and if it has not been blocked).
- **logout** does what you would expect but also, as the other methods, logs the event and can be used to trigger some event.
- **profile** allows users to edit their profile, i.e. the content of the ``auth_user`` table. Notice that this table does not have a fixed structure and can be customized.
- **change_password** allows users to change their password in a fail-safe way.
- **verify_email**. If email verification is turned on, then visitors, upon registration, receive an email with a link to verify their email information. The link points to this action.
- **retrieve_username**. By default, **Auth** uses email and password for login, but it can, optionally, use username instead of email. In this latter case, if a user forgets his/her username, the ``retrieve_username`` method allows the user to type the email address and retrieve the username by email.
- **request_reset_password**. Allows users who forgot their password to request a new password. They will get a confirmation email pointing to **reset_password**.
- **impersonate** allows a user to &quot;impersonate&quot; another user. This is important for debugging and for support purposes. ``request.args[0]`` is the id of the user to be impersonated. This is only allowed if the logged in user ``has_permission(&#x27;impersonate&#x27;, db.auth_user, user_id)``. You can use ``auth.is_impersonating()`` to check is the current user is impersonating somebody else.
- **groups** lists the groups of which the current logged in user is a member.
- **not_authorized** displays an error message when the visitor tried to do something that he/she is not authorized to do
- **navbar** is a helper that generates a bar with login/register/etc. links.

Logout, profile, change_password, impersonate, and groups require login.

By default they are all exposed, but it is possible to restrict access to only some of these actions.

All of the methods above can be extended or replaced by subclassing **Auth**.

All of the methods above can be used in separate actions. For example:

``
def mylogin(): return dict(form=auth.login())
def myregister(): return dict(form=auth.register())
def myprofile(): return dict(form=auth.profile())
...
``

To restrict access to functions to only logged in visitors, decorate the function as in the following example
``
@auth.requires_login()
def hello():
    return dict(message=&#x27;hello %(first_name)s&#x27; % auth.user)
``:code

Any function can be decorated, not just exposed actions. Of course this is still only a very simple example of access control. More complex examples will be discussed later.
``auth.user``:inxx ``auth.user_id``:inxx ``auth.user_groups``.

-----
``auth.user`` contains a copy of the ``db.auth_user`` records for the current logged in user or ``None`` otherwise. There is also a ``auth.user_id`` which is the same as ``auth.user.id`` (i.e. the id of the current logger in user) or ``None``. Similarly, ``auth.user_groups`` contains a dictionary where each key is the id of a group of with the current logged in user is member of, the value is the corresponding group role.
-----

``otherwise``:inxx

The ``auth.requires_login()`` decorator as well as the other ``auth.requires_*`` decorators take an optional ``otherwise`` argument. It can be set to a string where to redirect the user if registration files or to a callable object. It is called if registration fails.

#### Restrictions on registration

If you want to allow visitors to register but not to log in until registration has been approved by the administrator:
``
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = True
``:code

You can approve a registration via the appadmin interface. Look into the table ``auth_user``. Pending registrations have a ``registration_key`` field set to &quot;pending&quot;. A registration is approved when this field is set to blank.

Via the appadmin interface, you can also block a user from logging in. Locate the user in the table ``auth_user`` and set the ``registration_key`` to &quot;blocked&quot;. &quot;blocked&quot; users are not allowed to log in. Notice that this will prevent a visitor from logging in but it will not force a visitor who is already logged in to log out. The word &quot;disabled&quot; may be used instead of &quot;blocked&quot; if preferred, with exactly the same behavior.

You can also block access to the &quot;register&quot; page completely with this statement:
``
auth.settings.actions_disabled.append(&#x27;register&#x27;)
``:code

If you want to allow people to register and automatically log them in after registration but still want to send an email for verification so that they cannot login again after logout, unless they completed the instructions in the email, you can accomplish it as follows:

``
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = True
auth.settings.login_after_registration = True
``:code


from gluon.contrib.login_methods.x509_auth import X509Account
auth.settings.actions_disabled=[&#x27;register&#x27;,&#x27;change_password&#x27;,&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;]
auth.settings.login_form = X509Account()
``:code

You can now authenticate into web2py passing your x509 certificate. How to do this is browser-dependent, but probably you are more likely to use certificates for web services. In this case you can use for example ``cURL`` to try out your authentication:

``
curl -d &quot;firstName=John&amp;lastName=Smith&quot; -G -v --key private.key \
     --cert  server.crt https://example/app/default/user/profile
``

This works out of the box with Rocket (the web2py built-in web server) but you may need some extra configuration work on the web server side if you are using a different web server. In particular you need to tell your web server where the certificates are located on local host and that it needs to verify certificates coming from the clients. How to do it is web server dependent and therefore omitted here.

##### Multiple login forms

Some login methods modify the login_form, some do not. When they do that, they may not be able to coexist. Yet some coexist by providing multiple login forms in the same page. web2py provides a way to do it. Here is an example mixing normal login (auth) and RPX login (janrain.com):

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.extended_login_form import ExtendedLoginForm
other_form = RPXAccount(request, api_key=&#x27;...&#x27;, domain=&#x27;...&#x27;, url=&#x27;...&#x27;)
auth.settings.login_form = ExtendedLoginForm(auth, other_form, signals=[&#x27;token&#x27;])
``:code

If signals are set and a parameter in request matches any signals,
it will return the call of ``other_form.login_form`` instead.
``other_form`` can handle some particular situations, for example,
multiple steps of OpenID login inside ``other_form.login_form``.

Otherwise it will render the normal login form together with the ``other_form``.

#### Record versioning

You can use Auth to enable full record versioning:

``
db.enable_record_versioning(db,
    archive_db=None,
    archive_names=&#x27;%(tablename)s_archive&#x27;,
    current_record=&#x27;current_record&#x27;):
``:code

This tells web2py to create an archive table for each of the tables in ``db`` and store a copy of each record when modified. The old copy is stored. The new copy is not.

The last three parameters are optional:

- ``archive_db`` allows to specify another database where the archive tables are to be stored. Setting it to ``None`` is the same as setting it to ``db``.
- ``archive_names`` provides a pattern for naming each archive table.
- ``current_record`` specified the name of the reference field to be used in the archive table to refer to the original, unmodified, record. Notice that ``archive_db!=db`` then the reference field is just an integer field since cross database references are not possible.


Only tables with ``modified_by`` and ``modified_on`` fields (as created
for example by auth.signature) will be archived.

When you ``enable_record_versioning``, if records have an 
``is_active`` field (also created by auth.signature), 
records will never be deleted but they will be marked with ``is_active=False``.
In fact, ``enable_record_versioning`` adds a ``common_filter`` to 
every versioned table that filters out records with ``is_active=False`` so they essentially become invisible.

If you ``enable_record_versioning``, you should not use 
``auth.archive`` or ``crud.archive`` else you will end up with duplicate records.
Those functions do explicitly what ``enable_record_versioning`` does automatically and
they will be deprecated.


### ``Mail`` and ``Auth``

One can define a mailer with

``
from gluon.tools import Mail
mail = Mail()
mail.settings.server = &#x27;smtp.example.com:25&#x27;
mail.settings.sender = &#x27;you@example.com&#x27;
mail.settings.login = &#x27;username:password&#x27;

``

or simply use the mailer provided by ``auth``:

``
mail = auth.settings.mailer
mail.settings.server = &#x27;smtp.example.com:25&#x27;
mail.settings.sender = &#x27;you@example.com&#x27;
mail.settings.login = &#x27;username:password&#x27;
``

You need to replace the mail.settings with the proper parameters for your SMTP server. Set ``mail.settings.login = None`` if the SMTP server does not require authentication.

You can read more about web2py API for emails and email configuration in Chapter 8. Here we limit the discussion to the interaction between ``Mail`` and ``Auth``.

In ``Auth``, by default, email verification is disabled.
To enable email, append the following lines in the model where ``auth`` is defined:

``
auth.settings.registration_requires_verification = True
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = False
auth.settings.reset_password_requires_verification = True
auth.messages.verify_email = &#x27;Click on the link http://&#x27; + \
    request.env.http_host + \
    URL(r=request,c=&#x27;default&#x27;,f=&#x27;user&#x27;,args=[&#x27;verify_email&#x27;]) + \
    &#x27;/%(key)s to verify your email&#x27;
auth.messages.reset_password = &#x27;Click on the link http://&#x27; + \
    request.env.http_host + \
    URL(r=request,c=&#x27;default&#x27;,f=&#x27;user&#x27;,args=[&#x27;reset_password&#x27;]) + \
    &#x27;/%(key)s to reset your password&#x27;
``:code

In the two ``auth.messages`` above, you may need to replace the URL portion of the string with the proper complete URL of the action. This is necessary because web2py may be installed behind a proxy, and it cannot determine its own public URLs with absolute certainty. The above examples (which are the default values) should, however, work in most cases.

### Authorization

Once a new user is registered, a new group is created to contain the user. The role of the new user is conventionally &quot;user_[id]&quot; where [id] is the id of the newly created user. The creation of the group can be disabled with
``
auth.settings.create_user_groups = None
``:code

although we do not suggest doing so. Notice that ``create_user_groups`` is not a boolean (althought it can be ``False``) but it defaults to:

``
auth.settings.create_user_groups=&quot;user_%(id)s&quot;
``:code

It store a template for the name of the group created for user ``id``.

Users have membership in groups. Each group is identified by a name/role. Groups have permissions. Users have permissions because of the groups they belong to. By default each user is made member of their own group.

You can also also do
``
auth.settings.everybody_group_id = 5
``:code

to make any new user automatically member of group number 5. Here 5 is used as an example and we assume the group was created already.
</pre></div>
    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #F2DEDE;">-------
The ``password`` field of the ``db.auth_user`` table defaults to a ``CRYPT`` validator, which needs and ``hmac_key``. On legacy web2py applications you may see an extra argument passed to the Auth constructor: ``hmac_key = Auth.get_or_create_key()``. The latter is a function that read the hmac kay from a file &quot;private/auth.key&quot; within the application folder. If the file does not exist it creates a random ``hmac_key``. If multiple apps share the same auth database, make sure they also use the same ``hmac_key``. This is no loger necessary for new applications since passwords are salted with an individual random salt.
-------

By default, web2py uses email for login. If instead you want to log in using username set ``auth.define_tables(username=True)``

If multiple apps share the same auth database you may want to disable migrations: ``auth.define_tables(migrate=False)``.

To expose **Auth**, you also need the following function in a controller (for example in &quot;default.py&quot;):
``
def user(): return dict(form=auth())
``:code

-------
The ``auth`` object and the ``user`` action are already defined in the
scaffolding application.
-------

web2py also includes a sample view &quot;welcome/views/default/user.html&quot; to render this function properly that looks like this:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;{{=T( request.args(0).replace(&#x27;_&#x27;,&#x27; &#x27;).capitalize() )}}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;web2py_user_form&quot;&gt;
  {{=form}}
  {{if request.args(0)==&#x27;login&#x27;:}}
    {{if not &#x27;register&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;register&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
    {{if not &#x27;request_reset_password&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;lost password&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
  {{pass}}
&lt;/div&gt;
``:code

Notice that this function simply displays a ``form`` and therefore it can be customized using normal custom form syntax. The only caveat is that the form displayed by ``form=auth()`` depends on ``request.args(0)``; therefore, if you replace the default ``auth()`` login form with a custom login form, you may need an ``if`` statement like this in the view:

- ``auth_group`` stores groups or roles for users in a many-to-many structure. By default, each user is in its own group, but a user can be in multiple groups, and each group can contain multiple users. A group is identified by a role and a description.
- ``auth_membership`` links users and groups in a many-to-many structure.
- ``auth_permission`` links groups and permissions. A permission is identified by a name and, optionally, a table and a record. For example, members of a certain group can have &quot;update&quot; permissions on a specific record of a specific table.
- ``auth_event`` logs changes in the other tables and successful access via CRUD to objects controlled by the RBAC.
- ``auth_cas`` is used for Central Authentication Service (CAS). Every web2py application is a CAS provider and can optionally be a CAS consumer.

The schema is reproduced graphically in the image below:

In principle, there is no restriction on the names of the roles and the names of the permissions; the developer can create them to fix the roles and permissions in the organization. Once they have been created, web2py provides an API to check if a user is logged in, if a user is a member of a given group, and/or if the user is a member of any group that has a given required permission.

web2py also provides decorators to restrict access to any function based on login, membership and permissions.

web2py also understands some specific permissions, i.e., those that have a name that correspond to the CRUD methods (create, read, update, delete) and can enforce them automatically without the need to use decorators.

In this chapter, we are going to discuss different parts of RBAC one by one.

### Authentication

In order to use RBAC, users need to be identified. This means that they need to register (or be registered) and log in.

**Auth** provides multiple login methods. The default one consists of identifying users based on the local ``auth_user`` table.
Alternatively, it can log in users against third-party authentication systems and single sign on providers such as Google, PAM, LDAP, Facebook, LinkedIn, Dropbox, OpenID, OAuth, etc..

To start using ``Auth``, you need at least this code in a model file, which is also provided with the web2py &quot;welcome&quot; application and assumes a ``db`` connection object:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
``:code

Auth has an optional ``secure=True`` argument, which will force authenticated pages to go over HTTPS. ``https``:inxx

-------
The ``password`` field of the ``db.auth_user`` table defaults to a ``CRYPT`` validator, which needs and ``hmac_key``. On legacy web2py applications you may see an extra argument passed to the Auth constructor: ``hmac_key = Auth.get_or_create_key()``. The latter is a function that read the HMAC key from a file &quot;private/auth.key&quot; within the application folder. If the file does not exist it creates a random ``hmac_key``. If multiple apps share the same auth database, make sure they also use the same ``hmac_key``. This is no loger necessary for new applications since passwords are salted with an individual random salt.
-------

By default, web2py uses email for login. If instead you want to log in using username set ``auth.define_tables(username=True)``

If multiple apps share the same auth database you may want to disable migrations: ``auth.define_tables(migrate=False)``.

To expose **Auth**, you also need the following function in a controller (for example in &quot;default.py&quot;):
``
def user(): return dict(form=auth())
``:code

-------
The ``auth`` object and the ``user`` action are already defined in the
scaffolding application.
-------

web2py also includes a sample view &quot;welcome/views/default/user.html&quot; to render this function properly that looks like this:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;{{=T( request.args(0).replace(&#x27;_&#x27;,&#x27; &#x27;).capitalize() )}}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;web2py_user_form&quot;&gt;
  {{=form}}
  {{if request.args(0)==&#x27;login&#x27;:}}
    {{if not &#x27;register&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;register&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
    {{if not &#x27;request_reset_password&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;lost password&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
  {{pass}}
&lt;/div&gt;
``:code

Notice that this function simply displays a ``form`` and therefore it can be customized using normal custom form syntax. The only caveat is that the form displayed by ``form=auth()`` depends on ``request.args(0)``; therefore, if you replace the default ``auth()`` login form with a custom login form, you may need an ``if`` statement like this in the view:
``
{{if request.args(0)==&#x27;login&#x27;:}}...custom login form...{{pass}}
``:code

``auth.impersonate``:inxx ``auth.is_impersonating``:inxx

The controller above exposes multiple actions:
``
http://.../[app]/default/user/register
http://.../[app]/default/user/login
http://.../[app]/default/user/logout
http://.../[app]/default/user/profile
http://.../[app]/default/user/change_password
http://.../[app]/default/user/verify_email
http://.../[app]/default/user/retrieve_username
http://.../[app]/default/user/request_reset_password
http://.../[app]/default/user/reset_password
http://.../[app]/default/user/impersonate
http://.../[app]/default/user/groups
http://.../[app]/default/user/not_authorized
``:code
- **register** allows users to register. It is integrated with CAPTCHA, although this is disabled by default. This is also integrated with a client-side entropy calculator defined in &quot;web2py.js&quot;. The calculator indicates the strength of the new password. You can use the ``IS_STRONG`` validator to prevent web2py from accepting weak passwords.
- **login** allows users who are registered to log in (if the registration is verified or does not require verification, if it has been approved or does not require approval, and if it has not been blocked).
- **logout** does what you would expect but also, as the other methods, logs the event and can be used to trigger some event.
- **profile** allows users to edit their profile, i.e. the content of the ``auth_user`` table. Notice that this table does not have a fixed structure and can be customized.
- **change_password** allows users to change their password in a fail-safe way.
- **verify_email**. If email verification is turned on, then visitors, upon registration, receive an email with a link to verify their email information. The link points to this action.
- **retrieve_username**. By default, **Auth** uses email and password for login, but it can, optionally, use username instead of email. In this latter case, if a user forgets his/her username, the ``retrieve_username`` method allows the user to type the email address and retrieve the username by email.
- **request_reset_password**. Allows users who forgot their password to request a new password. They will get a confirmation email pointing to **reset_password**.
- **impersonate** allows a user to &quot;impersonate&quot; another user. This is important for debugging and for support purposes. ``request.args[0]`` is the id of the user to be impersonated. This is only allowed if the logged in user ``has_permission(&#x27;impersonate&#x27;, db.auth_user, user_id)``. You can use ``auth.is_impersonating()`` to check is the current user is impersonating somebody else.
- **groups** lists the groups of which the current logged in user is a member.
- **not_authorized** displays an error message when the visitor tried to do something that he/she is not authorized to do
- **navbar** is a helper that generates a bar with login/register/etc. links.

Logout, profile, change_password, impersonate, and groups require login.

By default they are all exposed, but it is possible to restrict access to only some of these actions.

All of the methods above can be extended or replaced by subclassing **Auth**.

All of the methods above can be used in separate actions. For example:

``
def mylogin(): return dict(form=auth.login())
def myregister(): return dict(form=auth.register())
def myprofile(): return dict(form=auth.profile())
...
``

To restrict access to functions to only logged in visitors, decorate the function as in the following example
``
@auth.requires_login()
mail.settings.login = &#x27;username:password&#x27;
You need to replace the mail.settings with the proper parameters for your SMTP server. Set ``mail.settings.login = None`` if the SMTP server does not require authentication.

You can read more about web2py API for emails and email configuration in Chapter 8. Here we limit the discussion to the interaction between ``Mail`` and ``Auth``.

In ``Auth``, by default, email verification is disabled.
To enable email, append the following lines in the model where ``auth`` is defined:

``
auth.settings.registration_requires_verification = True
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = False
auth.settings.reset_password_requires_verification = True
auth.messages.verify_email = &#x27;Click on the link http://&#x27; + \
    request.env.http_host + \
    URL(r=request,c=&#x27;default&#x27;,f=&#x27;user&#x27;,args=[&#x27;verify_email&#x27;]) + \
    &#x27;/%(key)s to verify your email&#x27;
auth.messages.reset_password = &#x27;Click on the link http://&#x27; + \
    request.env.http_host + \
    URL(r=request,c=&#x27;default&#x27;,f=&#x27;user&#x27;,args=[&#x27;reset_password&#x27;]) + \
    &#x27;/%(key)s to reset your password&#x27;
``:code

In the two ``auth.messages`` above, you may need to replace the URL portion of the string with the proper complete URL of the action. This is necessary because web2py may be installed behind a proxy, and it cannot determine its own public URLs with absolute certainty. The above examples (which are the default values) should, however, work in most cases.

### Authorization

Once a new user is registered, a new group is created to contain the user. The role of the new user is conventionally &quot;user_[id]&quot; where [id] is the id of the newly created user. The creation of the group can be disabled with
``
auth.settings.create_user_groups = None
``:code

although we do not suggest doing so. Notice that ``create_user_groups`` is not a boolean (although it can be ``False``) but it defaults to:

It store a template for the name of the group created for user ``id``.

Users have membership in groups. Each group is identified by a name/role. Groups have permissions. Users have permissions because of the groups they belong to. By default each user is made member of their own group.

    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #F2DEDE;">-------
The ``password`` field of the ``db.auth_user`` table defaults to a ``CRYPT`` validator, which needs and ``hmac_key``. On legacy web2py applications you may see an extra argument passed to the Auth constructor: ``hmac_key = Auth.get_or_create_key()``. The latter is a function that read the HMAC key from a file &quot;private/auth.key&quot; within the application folder. If the file does not exist it creates a random ``hmac_key``. If multiple apps share the same auth database, make sure they also use the same ``hmac_key``. This is no loger necessary for new applications since passwords are salted with an individual random salt.
-------

By default, web2py uses email for login. If instead you want to log in using username set ``auth.define_tables(username=True)``

If multiple apps share the same auth database you may want to disable migrations: ``auth.define_tables(migrate=False)``.

To expose **Auth**, you also need the following function in a controller (for example in &quot;default.py&quot;):
``
def user(): return dict(form=auth())
``:code

-------
The ``auth`` object and the ``user`` action are already defined in the
scaffolding application.
-------

web2py also includes a sample view &quot;welcome/views/default/user.html&quot; to render this function properly that looks like this:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;{{=T( request.args(0).replace(&#x27;_&#x27;,&#x27; &#x27;).capitalize() )}}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;web2py_user_form&quot;&gt;
  {{=form}}
  {{if request.args(0)==&#x27;login&#x27;:}}
    {{if not &#x27;register&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;register&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
    {{if not &#x27;request_reset_password&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;lost password&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
auth.settings.registration_requires_approval = False
auth.settings.reset_password_requires_verification = True
auth.messages.verify_email = &#x27;Click on the link http://&#x27; + \
    request.env.http_host + \
    URL(r=request,c=&#x27;default&#x27;,f=&#x27;user&#x27;,args=[&#x27;verify_email&#x27;]) + \
    &#x27;/%(key)s to verify your email&#x27;
auth.messages.reset_password = &#x27;Click on the link http://&#x27; + \
    request.env.http_host + \
    URL(r=request,c=&#x27;default&#x27;,f=&#x27;user&#x27;,args=[&#x27;reset_password&#x27;]) + \
    &#x27;/%(key)s to reset your password&#x27;
``:code

In the two ``auth.messages`` above, you may need to replace the URL portion of the string with the proper complete URL of the action. This is necessary because web2py may be installed behind a proxy, and it cannot determine its own public URLs with absolute certainty. The above examples (which are the default values) should, however, work in most cases.

### Authorization

Once a new user is registered, a new group is created to contain the user. The role of the new user is conventionally &quot;user_[id]&quot; where [id] is the id of the newly created user. The creation of the group can be disabled with
``
auth.settings.create_user_groups = None
``:code

although we do not suggest doing so. Notice that ``create_user_groups`` is not a boolean (although it can be ``False``) but it defaults to:

``
auth.settings.create_user_groups=&quot;user_%(id)s&quot;
``:code

It store a template for the name of the group created for user ``id``.

Users have membership in groups. Each group is identified by a name/role. Groups have permissions. Users have permissions because of the groups they belong to. By default each user is made member of their own group.

You can also also do
``
auth.settings.everybody_group_id = 5

- **change_password** allows users to change their password in a fail-safe way.
- **verify_email**. If email verification is turned on, then visitors, upon registration, receive an email with a link to verify their email information. The link points to this action.

In this latter case, if a user forgets his/her username, the ``retrieve_username`` method allows the user to type the email address and retrieve the username by email.

-----
``auth.user`` contains a copy of the ``db.auth_user`` records for the current logged in user or ``None`` otherwise. There is also a ``auth.user_id`` which is the same as ``auth.user.id`` (i.e. the id of the current logger in user) or ``None``.
-----

``otherwise``:inxx

The ``auth.requires_login()`` decorator as well as the other ``auth.requires_*`` decorators take an optional ``otherwise`` argument. It can be set to a string where to redirect the user if registration files or to a callable object. It is called if registration fails.

-----
``auth.user`` contains a copy of the ``db.auth_user`` records for the current logged in user or ``None`` otherwise. There is also a ``auth.user_id`` which is the same as ``auth.user.id`` (i.e. the id of the current logger in user) or ``None``.

    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #DFF0D8;">-------
The ``password`` field of the ``db.auth_user`` table defaults to a ``CRYPT`` validator, which needs and ``hmac_key``. On legacy web2py applications you may see an extra argument passed to the Auth constructor: ``hmac_key = Auth.get_or_create_key()``. The latter is a function that read the hmac kay from a file &quot;private/auth.key&quot; within the application folder. If the file does not exist it creates a random ``hmac_key``. If multiple apps share the same auth database, make sure they also use the same ``hmac_key``. This is no loger necessary for new applications since passwords are salted with an individual random salt.
-------

By default, web2py uses email for login. If instead you want to log in using username set ``auth.define_tables(username=True)``

If multiple apps share the same auth database you may want to disable migrations: ``auth.define_tables(migrate=False)``.

To expose **Auth**, you also need the following function in a controller (for example in &quot;default.py&quot;):
``
def user(): return dict(form=auth())
``:code

-------
The ``auth`` object and the ``user`` action are already defined in the
scaffolding application.
-------

web2py also includes a sample view &quot;welcome/views/default/user.html&quot; to render this function properly that looks like this:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;{{=T( request.args(0).replace(&#x27;_&#x27;,&#x27; &#x27;).capitalize() )}}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;web2py_user_form&quot;&gt;
  {{=form}}
  {{if request.args(0)==&#x27;login&#x27;:}}
    {{if not &#x27;register&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;register&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
    {{if not &#x27;request_reset_password&#x27; in auth.settings.actions_disabled:}}
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;{{=URL(args=&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;)}}&quot;&gt;lost password&lt;/a&gt;
    {{pass}}
You can use it in all types of SQLFORM by injection:

``
form = SQLFORM(...) or SQLFORM.factory(...)
form.element(&#x27;table&#x27;).insert(-1,TR(&#x27;&#x27;,Recaptcha(...),&#x27;&#x27;))
``:code

#### Customizing ``Auth``

The call to
``
auth.define_tables()
``:code

defines all **Auth** tables that have not been defined already. This means that if you wish to do so, you can define your own ``auth_user`` table.

There are a number of ways to customize auth. The simplest way is to add extra fields:

``
## after auth = Auth(db)
auth.settings.extra_fields[&#x27;auth_user&#x27;]= [
  Field(&#x27;address&#x27;),
  Field(&#x27;city&#x27;),
  Field(&#x27;zip&#x27;),
  Field(&#x27;phone&#x27;)]
## before auth.define_tables(username=True)
``

You can declare extra fields not just for table &quot;auth_user&quot; but also for other &quot;auth_&quot; tables.
Using ``extra_fields`` is the recommended way as it will not break any internal mechanism.

Another way to do this (for experts!) consists of defining your auth tables yourself. If a table is declared before ``auth.define_tables()`` it is used instead of the default one. Here is how to do it:

``
## after auth = Auth(db)
db.define_table(
    auth.settings.table_user_name,
    Field(&#x27;first_name&#x27;, length=128, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;last_name&#x27;, length=128, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;email&#x27;, length=128, default=&#x27;&#x27;, unique=True), # required
    Field(&#x27;password&#x27;, &#x27;password&#x27;, length=512,            # required
          readable=False, label=&#x27;Password&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;address&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;city&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;zip&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;phone&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;registration_key&#x27;, length=512,                # required
          writable=False, readable=False, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;reset_password_key&#x27;, length=512,              # required
          writable=False, readable=False, default=&#x27;&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;registration_id&#x27;, length=512,                 # required
          writable=False, readable=False, default=&#x27;&#x27;))

## do not forget validators
custom_auth_table = db[auth.settings.table_user_name] # get the custom_auth_table
custom_auth_table.first_name.requires = \
  IS_NOT_EMPTY(error_message=auth.messages.is_empty)
custom_auth_table.last_name.requires = \
  IS_NOT_EMPTY(error_message=auth.messages.is_empty)
custom_auth_table.password.requires = [IS_STRONG(), CRYPT()]
custom_auth_table.email.requires = [
  IS_EMAIL(error_message=auth.messages.invalid_email),
auth.settings.login_form=FaceBookAccount()
##### LinkedIn
``LinkedIn``:inxx

We have previously discussed integration with Janrain (which has LinkedIn support) and that is the easiest way to use OAuth. Yet sometime you do not want to rely on a third party service or you may want to access LinkedIn directly to get more information than Janrain provides.

Here is an example:

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.linkedin_account import LinkedInAccount
auth.settings.login_form=LinkedInAccount(request,KEY,SECRET,RETURN_URL)
``:code

``LinkedInAccount`` requires the &quot;python-linkedin&quot; module installed separately.

##### X509

You can also login by passing to the page an x509 certificate and your credential will be extracted from the certificate. This requires ``M2Crypto`` installed from

``
http://chandlerproject.org/bin/view/Projects/MeTooCrypto
``

Once you have M2Cryption installed you can do:

``
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.x509_auth import X509Account
auth.settings.actions_disabled=[&#x27;register&#x27;,&#x27;change_password&#x27;,&#x27;request_reset_password&#x27;]
auth.settings.login_form = X509Account()
``:code

You can now authenticate into web2py passing your x509 certificate. How to do this is browser-dependent, but probably you are more likely to use certificates for web services. In this case you can use for example ``cURL`` to try out your authentication:
