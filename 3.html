``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The following form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it (using different names
allows you to install multiple copies of the same application). You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or Instant Press CMS created by Martin Mulone:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or one of the many example applications available at:

------
Web2py files are packages as ``.w2p`` files. These ones are tar gzipped files. Web2py uses the ``.w2p`` extension instead of the ``.tgz`` extension to prevent the browser from unzipping on download. They can be uncompressed manually with ``tar zxvf [filename]`` although this is never necessary.

Upon successful upload, web2py displays the MD5 checksum of the uploaded file. You can use it to verify that the file was not corrupted during upload. The InstantPress name will appear in the list of installed applications.

If you run web2py from source and you have ``gitpython`` installed (if necessary, set it up with &#x27;easy_install gitpython&#x27;), you can install applications directly from git repositories

##### Integrated debugger

&#x27;&#x27;(requires Python 2.6 or later)&#x27;&#x27;

The web2py admin includes a web based debugger. Using the provided web-based editor you can add breakpoints to the Python code and, from the associated debugger console, you can inspect the system variables at those breakpoints and resume execution. This is illustrated in the following screenshot:

[[image @///image/debugger.png center 480px]]

This functionality is based on the Qdb debugger created by Mariano Reingart.
It uses multiprocessing.connection to communicate between the backend
and frontend, with a JSON-RPC-like stream protocol. ``qdb``:cite

##### Shell

If you click on the &quot;shell&quot; link under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27;, web2py will open a web based Python shell and will execute the models for the current application. This allows you to interactively talk to your application.

[[image @///image/en4700.png center 480px]]

-------
Be careful using the web based shell - because different shell requests will be executed in different threads. This easily gives errors, especially if you play with databases
creation and connections. For activities like these (i.e. if you need persistence) it&#x27;s much better to use the python command line.

#### Say hello
``index``:inxx

Here, as an example, we create a simple web app that displays the message &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot; to the user. We will call this application &quot;myapp&quot;. We will also add a counter that counts how many times the same user visits the page.

You can create a new application simply by typing its name in the form on the top right of the **site** page in **admin**.

[[image @///image/en800.png center 447px]]

After you press [create], the application is created as a copy of the built-in welcome application.

[[image @///image/en900.png center 480px]]

To run the new application, visit:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp
``:code

Now you have a copy of the welcome application.

To edit an application, click on the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; button for the newly created application.

The **edit** page tells you what is inside the application.
Every web2py application consists of certain files, most of which fall into one of six categories:
- **models**: describe the data representation.
- **controllers**: describe the application logic and workflow.
- **views**: describe the data presentation.
- **languages**: describe how to translate the application presentation to other languages.
- **modules**: Python modules that belong to the application.
- **static files**: static images, CSS  files``css:w,css:o,css:school``:cite , JavaScript files``js:w,js:b``:cite , etc.
- **plugins**: groups of files designed to work together.
Now the action returns a dictionary defining a ``message``. When an action retur

If web2py does not find the requested view, it uses the &quot;generic.html&quot; view that comes with every application.

-------
``Mac Mail``:inxx ``Google Maps``:inxx ``jsonp``:inxx
If an extension other than &quot;html&quot; is specified (&quot;json&quot; for example), and the view file &quot;[controller]/[function].json&quot; is not found, web2py looks for the view &quot;generic.json&quot;. web2py comes with generic.html, generic.json, generic.jsonp, generic.xml, generic.rss, generic.ics (for Mac Mail Calendar), generic.map (for embedding Google Maps), and generic.pdf (based on fpdf). These generic views can be modified for each application individually, and additional views can be added easily.
-------

-------
Generic views are a development tool. In production every action should have its own view. In fact, by default, generic views are only enabled from localhost.
-------

-------
You can also specify a view with ``response.view = &#x27;default/something.html&#x27;``
-------

Read more on this topic in Chapter 10.

If you go back to &quot;EDIT&quot; and click on index, you will now see the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1200.png center 480px]]

For debugging purposes you can always append

``
{{=response.toolbar()}}
``:code

to the code in a view and it will show you some useful information, including the request, response and session objects, and list all db queries with their timing.

#### Let&#x27;s count
``session``:inxx
Let&#x27;s now add a counter to this page that will count how many times the same visitor displays the page.

web2py automatically and transparently tracks visitors using sessions and cookies. For each new visitor, it creates a session and assigns a unique &quot;session_id&quot;. The session is a container for variables that are stored server-side. The unique id is sent to the browser via a cookie. When the visitor requests another page from the same application, the browser sends the cookie back, it is retrieved by web2py, and the corresponding session is restored.

To use the session, modify the default controller:
``
def index():
    if not session.counter:
        session.counter = 1
    else:
        session.counter += 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
``:code

Notice that ``counter`` is not a web2py keyword but ``session`` is. We are asking web2py to check whether there is a counter variable in the session and, if not, to create one and set it to 1. If the counter is there, we ask web2py to increase the counter by 1. Finally we pass the value of the counter to the view.

A more compact way to code the same function is this:
``
def index():
    session.counter = (session.counter or 0) + 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
``:code

Now modify the view to add a line that displays the value of the counter:
``
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{=message}}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Number of visits: {{=counter}}&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
``:code

When you visit the index page again (and again) you should get the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1300.png center 480px]]

The counter is associated with each visitor, and is incremented each time the visitor reloads the page. Different visitors see different counters.

#### Say my name
``form``:inxx ``request.vars``:inxx

Now create two pages (first and second), where the first page creates a form, asks the visitor&#x27;s name, and redirects to the second page, which greets the visitor by name.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1400.png center 293px]]

Write the corresponding actions in the default controller:
``
def first():
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then create a view &quot;default/first.html&quot; for the first action,
and enter:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
What is your name?
&lt;form action=&quot;second&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

Finally, create a view &quot;default/second.html&quot; for the second action:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=request.vars.visitor_name}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

``layout``:inxx
In both views we have extended the basic &quot;layout.html&quot; view that comes with web2py. The layout view keeps the look and feel of the two pages coherent. The layout file can be edited and replaced easily, since it mainly contains HTML code.

If you now visit the first page, type your name:

[[image @///image/en1500.png center 480px]]

and submit the form, you will receive a greeting:

[[image @///image/en1600.png center 480px]]

#### Postbacks
``redirect``:inxx ``URL``:inxx ``postback``:inxx

The mechanism for form submission that we used before is very common, but it is not good programming practice. All input should be validated and, in the above example, the burden of validation would fall on the second action. Thus the action that performs the validation is different from the action that generated the form. This tends to cause redundancy in the code.

A better pattern for form submission is to submit forms to the same action that generated them, in our example the &quot;first&quot;. The &quot;first&quot; action should receive the variables, process them, store them server-side, and redirect the visitor to the &quot;second&quot; page, which retrieves the variables. This mechanism is called a &#x27;&#x27;postback&#x27;&#x27;.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1700.png center 293px]]

Modify the default controller to implement self-submission:
``
def first():
    if request.vars.visitor_name:
        session.visitor_name = request.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then modify the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
What is your name?
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;
     src=&quot;{{=URL(&#x27;download&#x27;, args=image.file)}}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
{{if len(comments):}}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  {{for comment in comments:}}
    &lt;p&gt;{{=comment.author}} says &lt;i&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  {{pass}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{else:}}
  &lt;h2&gt;No comments posted yet&lt;/h2&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

This view displays the **image.file** by calling the &quot;download&quot; action inside an ``&lt;img ... /&gt;`` tag.
If there are comments, it loops over them and displays each one.

Here is how everything will appear to a visitor.

[[image @///image/en2900.png center 480px]]

When a visitor submits a comment via this page, the comment is stored in the database and appended at the bottom of the page.

#### Adding Authentication

The web2py API for Role-Based Access Control is quite sophisticated, but for now we will limit ourselves to restricting access to the show action to authenticated users, deferring a more detailed discussion to Chapter 9.

To limit access to authenticated users, we need to complete three steps. In a model, for example &quot;db.py&quot;, we need to add:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables(username=True)
``:code

In our controller, we need to add one action:
``
def user():
    return dict(form=auth())
``:code

This is sufficient to enable login, register, logout, etc. pages. The default layout will also show options to the corresponding pages in the top right corner.

[[image @///image/en3000.png center 300px]]

We can now decorate the functions that we want to restrict, for example:
``
@auth.requires_login()
def show():
    ...
``:code

Any attempt to access
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/[image_id]
We can improve this further using the ``SQLFORM.grid`` and ``SQLFORM.smartgrid``

``
@auth.requires_membership(&#x27;manager&#x27;)
def manage():
    grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.image,linked_tables=[&#x27;comment&#x27;])
    return dict(grid=grid)
``:code

with associated &quot;views/default/manage.html&quot;

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;Management Interface&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``

Using appadmin create a group &quot;manager&quot; and make some users members of the group. They will not be able to access

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/manage
``

and browse, search:

[[image @///image/en3200.png center 480px]]

create, update and delete images and their comments:

[[image @///image/en3300.png center 480px]]

#### Configuring the layout
</pre></div>
    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #F2DEDE;">### Say hello
``index``:inxx

Here, as an example, we create a simple web app that displays the message &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot; to the user. We will call this application &quot;myapp&quot;. We will also add a counter that counts how many times the same user visits the page.

You can create a new application simply by typing its name in the form on the top right of the **site** page in **admin**.

[[image @///image/en800.png center 447px]]

After you press [create], the application is created as a copy of the built-in welcome application.

[[image @///image/en900.png center 480px]]

To run the new application, visit:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp
``:code

Now you have a copy of the welcome application.

To edit an application, click on the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; button for the newly created application.

The **edit** page tells you what is inside the application.
Every web2py application consists of certain files, most of which fall into one of six categories:
- **models**: describe the data representation.
- **controllers**: describe the application logic and workflow.
- **views**: describe the data presentation.
- **languages**: describe how to translate the application presentation to other languages.
- **modules**: Python modules that belong to the application.
- **static files**: static images, CSS  files``css:w,css:o,css:school``:cite , JavaScript files``js:w,js:b``:cite , etc.
- **plugins**: groups of files designed to work together.
Now the action returns a dictionary defining a ``message``. When an action retur

If web2py does not find the requested view, it uses the &quot;generic.html&quot; view that comes with every application.

-------
``Mac Mail``:inxx ``Google Maps``:inxx ``jsonp``:inxx
If an extension other than &quot;html&quot; is specified (&quot;json&quot; for example), and the view file &quot;[controller]/[function].json&quot; is not found, web2py looks for the view &quot;generic.json&quot;. web2py comes with generic.html, generic.json, generic.jsonp, generic.xml, generic.rss, generic.ics (for Mac Mail Calendar), generic.map (for embedding Google Maps), and generic.pdf (based on fpdf). These generic views can be modified for each application individually, and additional views can be added easily.
-------

-------
Generic views are a development tool. In production every action should have its own view. In fact, by default, generic views are only enabled from localhost.
-------

-------
You can also specify a view with ``response.view = &#x27;default/something.html&#x27;``
-------

Read more on this topic in Chapter 10.

If you go back to &quot;EDIT&quot; and click on index, you will now see the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1200.png center 480px]]

For debugging purposes you can always append

``
{{=response.toolbar()}}
``:code

to the code in a view and it will show you some useful information, including the request, response and session objects, and list all db queries with their timing.

### Let&#x27;s count
``session``:inxx
Let&#x27;s now add a counter to this page that will count how many times the same visitor displays the page.

web2py automatically and transparently tracks visitors using sessions and cookies. For each new visitor, it creates a session and assigns a unique &quot;session_id&quot;. The session is a container for variables that are stored server-side. The unique id is sent to the browser via a cookie. When the visitor requests another page from the same application, the browser sends the cookie back, it is retrieved by web2py, and the corresponding session is restored.

To use the session, modify the default controller:
``
def index():
    if not session.counter:
        session.counter = 1
    else:
        session.counter += 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
``:code

Notice that ``counter`` is not a web2py keyword but ``session`` is. We are asking web2py to check whether there is a counter variable in the session and, if not, to create one and set it to 1. If the counter is there, we ask web2py to increase the counter by 1. Finally we pass the value of the counter to the view.

A more compact way to code the same function is this:
``
def index():
    session.counter = (session.counter or 0) + 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
``:code

Now modify the view to add a line that displays the value of the counter:
``
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{=message}}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Number of visits: {{=counter}}&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
``:code

When you visit the index page again (and again) you should get the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1300.png center 480px]]

The counter is associated with each visitor, and is incremented each time the visitor reloads the page. Different visitors see different counters.

### Say my name
``form``:inxx ``request.vars``:inxx

Now create two pages (first and second), where the first page creates a form, asks the visitor&#x27;s name, and redirects to the second page, which greets the visitor by name.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1400.png center 293px]]

Write the corresponding actions in the default controller:
``
def first():
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then create a view &quot;default/first.html&quot; for the first action,
and enter:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
What is your name?
&lt;form action=&quot;second&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

Finally, create a view &quot;default/second.html&quot; for the second action:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=request.vars.visitor_name}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

``layout``:inxx
In both views we have extended the basic &quot;layout.html&quot; view that comes with web2py. The layout view keeps the look and feel of the two pages coherent. The layout file can be edited and replaced easily, since it mainly contains HTML code.

If you now visit the first page, type your name:

[[image @///image/en1500.png center 480px]]

and submit the form, you will receive a greeting:

[[image @///image/en1600.png center 480px]]

### Postbacks
``redirect``:inxx ``URL``:inxx ``postback``:inxx

The mechanism for form submission that we used before is very common, but it is not good programming practice. All input should be validated and, in the above example, the burden of validation would fall on the second action. Thus the action that performs the validation is different from the action that generated the form. This tends to cause redundancy in the code.

A better pattern for form submission is to submit forms to the same action that generated them, in our example the &quot;first&quot;. The &quot;first&quot; action should receive the variables, process them, store them server-side, and redirect the visitor to the &quot;second&quot; page, which retrieves the variables. This mechanism is called a &#x27;&#x27;postback&#x27;&#x27;.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1700.png center 293px]]

Modify the default controller to implement self-submission:
``
def first():
    if request.vars.visitor_name:
        session.visitor_name = request.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then modify the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
What is your name?
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;
     src=&quot;{{=URL(&#x27;download&#x27;, args=image.file)}}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
{{if len(comments):}}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  {{for comment in comments:}}
    &lt;p&gt;{{=comment.author}} says &lt;i&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  {{pass}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{else:}}
  &lt;h2&gt;No comments posted yet&lt;/h2&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

This view displays the **image.file** by calling the &quot;download&quot; action inside an ``&lt;img ... /&gt;`` tag.
If there are comments, it loops over them and displays each one.

Here is how everything will appear to a visitor.

[[image @///image/en2900.png center 480px]]

When a visitor submits a comment via this page, the comment is stored in the database and appended at the bottom of the page.

### Adding Authentication

The web2py API for Role-Based Access Control is quite sophisticated, but for now we will limit ourselves to restricting access to the show action to authenticated users, deferring a more detailed discussion to Chapter 9.

To limit access to authenticated users, we need to complete three steps. In a model, for example &quot;db.py&quot;, we need to add:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables(username=True)
``:code

In our controller, we need to add one action:
``
def user():
    return dict(form=auth())
``:code

This is sufficient to enable login, register, logout, etc. pages. The default layout will also show options to the corresponding pages in the top right corner.

[[image @///image/en3000.png center 300px]]

We can now decorate the functions that we want to restrict, for example:
``
@auth.requires_login()
def show():
    ...
``:code

Any attempt to access
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/[image_id]
We can improve this further using the ``SQLFORM.grid`` and ``SQLFORM.smartgrid``

``
@auth.requires_membership(&#x27;manager&#x27;)
def manage():
    grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.image,linked_tables=[&#x27;comment&#x27;])
    return dict(grid=grid)
``:code

with associated &quot;views/default/manage.html&quot;

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;Management Interface&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``

Using appadmin create a group &quot;manager&quot; and make some users members of the group. They will not be able to access

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/manage
``

and browse, search:

[[image @///image/en3200.png center 480px]]

create, update and delete images and their comments:

[[image @///image/en3300.png center 480px]]

When you create a new application using **admin**, it starts as a clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; scaffolding app with a &quot;models/db.py&quot; that creates a SQLite database, connects to it, instantiates Auth, Crud, and Service, and configures them. It also provides a &quot;controller/default.py&quot; which exposes actions &quot;index&quot;, &quot;download&quot;, &quot;user&quot; for user management, and &quot;call&quot; for services. In the following, we assume that these files have been removed; we will be creating apps from scratch.
-----

web2py also comes with a **wizard**, described later in this chapter, that can write an alternate scaffolding code for you based on layouts and plugins available on the web and based on high level description of the models.

### Simple examples

#### Say hello
``index``:inxx

Here, as an example, we create a simple web app that displays the message &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot; to the user. We will call this application &quot;myapp&quot;. We will also add a counter that counts how many times the same user visits the page.

You can create a new application simply by typing its name in the form on the top right of the **site** page in **admin**.

[[image @///image/en800.png center 447px]]

After you press [create], the application is created as a copy of the built-in welcome application.

[[image @///image/en900.png center 480px]]

To run the new application, visit:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp
``:code

Now you have a copy of the welcome application.

To edit an application, click on the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; button for the newly created application.

The **edit** page tells you what is inside the application.
Every web2py application consists of certain files, most of which fall into one of six categories:
- **models**: describe the data representation.
- **controllers**: describe the application logic and workflow.
- **views**: describe the data presentation.
- **languages**: describe how to translate the application presentation to other languages.
- **modules**: Python modules that belong to the application.
- **static files**: static images, CSS  files``css-w,css-o,css-school``:cite , JavaScript files``js-w,js-b``:cite , etc.
- **plugins**: groups of files designed to work together.

Everything is neatly organized following the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Each section in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page corresponds to a subfolder in the application folder.

Notice that clicking on section headings will toggle their content. Folder names under static files are also collapsible.

-------
Each file listed in the section corresponds to a file physically located in the subfolder. Any operation performed on a file via the **admin** interface (create, edit, delete) can be performed directly from the shell using your favorite editor.
-------

The application contains other types of files (database, session files, error files, etc.), but they are not listed on the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page because they are not created or modified by the administrator; they are created and modified by the application itself.

The controllers contain the logic and workflow of the application. Every URL gets mapped into a call to one of the functions in the controllers (actions). There are two default controllers: &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and &quot;default.py&quot;. **appadmin** provides the database administrative interface; we do not need it now. &quot;default.py&quot; is the controller that you need to edit, the one that is called by default when no controller is specified in the URL. Edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def index():
    return &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;
``:code

Here is what the online editor looks like:

[[image @///image/en1000.png center 480px]]

Save it and go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. Click on the index link to visit the newly created page.

When you visit the URL
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/default/index
``:code

the index action in the default controller of the myapp application is called. It returns a string that the browser displays for us. It should look like this:

[[image @///image/en1100.png center 480px]]

Now, edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def first():

The ``form`` object can be easily serialized in HTML by embedding it in the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view.
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=form}}
``:code

The ``form.process()`` method applies the validators and returns the form itself. The ``form.accepted`` variable is set to True if the form was processed and passed validation. If the self-submitted form passes validation, it stores the variables in the session and redirects as before. If the form does not pass validation, error messages are inserted into the form and shown to the user, as below:

[[image @///image/en1800.png center 480px]]

In the next section we will show how forms can be generated automatically from a model.

In all or examples we have used the session to pass the user name from the first action to the second. We could have used a different mechanism and pass data as part of a redirect URL:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;,vars=dict(name=name)))
    return dict(form=form)

def second():
    name = request.vars.visitor_name or redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
    return dict(name=name)
``:code

#### Internationalization

Your code is likely to include hardcoded strings such as &quot;What is your name?&quot;. You should be able to customize strings without editing the code and in particular insert translations for these strings in different languages. In this way if a visitor has the language preference of the browser set to &quot;Italian&quot;, web2py will use the Italian translation for the strings, if available. This feature of web2py is called &quot;internationalization&quot; and it is described in more detail in the next chapter.

Here we just observe that in order to use this feature you should markup strings that needs translation. This is done by wrapping a quoted string in code such as

``
&quot;What is your name?&quot;
``:code

with the ``T`` operator:

``
T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)
``:code


You can also mark for translations strings hardcoded in views. For example

``
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

becomes

``
&lt;h1&gt;{{=T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

It is good practice to do this for every string in the code (field labels, flash messages, etc.) except for tables and field names.

Once the strings are identified and marked up, web2py takes care of almost everything else. The admin interface also provides a page where you can translate each string in the languages you desire to support.

### An image blog
``upload``:inxx

Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments (posts).

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;post&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;email&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;))

db.image.title.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)
db.post.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
db.post.author.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()
db.post.email.requires = IS_EMAIL()
db.post.body.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()

db.post.image_id.writable = db.post.image_id.readable = False
``:code

Let&#x27;s analyze this line by line.

Line 1 defines a global variable called ``db`` that represents the database connection. In this case it is a connection to a SQLite database stored in the file  &quot;applications/images/databases/storage.sqlite&quot;. When using SQLite, if the database file does not exist, it is created. You can change the name of the file, as well as the name of the global variable ``db``, but it is convenient to give them the same name, to make it easy to remember.

Lines 3-5 define a table &quot;image&quot;. ``define_table`` is a method of the ``db`` object. The first argument, &quot;image&quot;, is the name of the table we are defining. The other arguments are the fields belonging to that table. This table has a field called &quot;title&quot;, a field called &quot;file&quot;, and a field called &quot;id&quot; that serves as the table primary key (&quot;id&quot; is not explicitly declared because all tables have an id field by default). The field &quot;title&quot; is a string, and the field &quot;file&quot; is of type &quot;upload&quot;. &quot;upload&quot; is a special type of field used by the web2py Data Abstraction Layer (DAL) to store the names of uploaded files. web2py knows how to upload files (via streaming if they are large), rename them safely, and store them.

When a table is defined, web2py takes one of several possible actions:
- if the table does not exist, the table is created;
- if the table exists and does not correspond to the definition, the table is altered accordingly, and if a field has a different type, web2py tries to convert its contents;
- if the table exists and corresponds to the definition, web2py does nothing.

This behavior is called &quot;migration&quot;. In web2py migrations are automatic, but can be disabled for each table by passing ``migrate=False`` as the last argument of ``define_table``.

Line 6 defines a format string for the table. It determines how a record should be represented as a string. Notice that the ``format`` argument can also be a function that takes a record and returns a string. For example:

``
format=lambda row: row.title
``:code

Lines 8-12 define another table called &quot;post&quot;.
A post has an &quot;author&quot;, an &quot;email&quot; (we intend to store the email address of the author of the post), a &quot;body&quot; of type &quot;text&quot; (we intend to use it to store the actual comment posted by the author), and an &quot;image_id&quot; field of type reference that points to ``db.image`` via the &quot;id&quot; field.

In line 14, ``db.image.title`` represents the field &quot;title&quot; of table &quot;image&quot;. The attribute ``requires`` allows you to set requirements/constraints that will be enforced by web2py forms. Here we require that the &quot;title&quot; is unique:

``IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)``:code

&#x27;&#x27;Notice this is optional because it is set automatically given that ``Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True)``&#x27;&#x27;.

The objects representing these constraints are called validators. Multiple validators can be grouped in a list. Validators are executed in the order they appear.
``IS_NOT_IN_DB(a, b)`` is a special validator that checks that the value of a field ``b`` for a new record is not already in ``a``.

Line 15 requires that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;post&quot; is in ``db.image.id``. As far as the database is concerned, we had already declared this  when we defined the table &quot;post&quot;.
Now we are explicitly telling the model that this condition should be enforced by web2py, too, at the form processing level when a new comment is posted, so that invalid values do not propagate from input forms to the database. We also require that the &quot;image_id&quot; be represented by the &quot;title&quot;, ``&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;``, of the corresponding record.

Line 20 indicates that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;post&quot; should not be shown in forms, ``writable=False`` and not even in read-only forms, ``readable=False``.

The meaning of the validators in lines 15-17 should be obvious.

``format``:inxx
Notice that the validator
``
db.post.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

can be omitted (and would be automatic) if we specify a format for referenced table:
``
db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;, ..., format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

where the format can be a string or a function that takes a record and returns a string.

``appadmin``:inxx
Once a model is defined, if there are no errors, web2py creates an application administration interface to manage the database. You access it via the &quot;database administration&quot; link in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page or directly:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/appadmin
``:code

Here is a screenshot of the **appadmin** interface:

[[image @///image/en2100.png center 480px]]

This interface is coded in the controller called &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and the corresponding view &quot;appadmin.html&quot;. From now on, we will refer to this interface simply as **appadmin**. It allows the administrator to insert new database records, edit and delete existing records, browse tables, and perform database joins.

The first time **appadmin** is accessed, the model is executed and the tables are created. The web2py DAL translates Python code into SQL statements that are specific to the selected database back-end (SQLite in this example). You can see the generated SQL from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page by clicking on the &quot;sql.log&quot; link under &quot;models&quot;. Notice that the link is not present until the tables have been created.

[[image @///image/en2200.png center 480px]]

If you were to edit the model and access **appadmin** again, web2py would generate SQL to alter the existing tables. The generated SQL is logged into &quot;sql.log&quot;.

Now go back to **appadmin** and try to insert a new image record:

[[image @///image/en2300.png center 480px]]

web2py has translated the ``db.image.file`` &quot;upload&quot; field into an upload form for the file. When the form is submitted and an image file is uploaded, the file is renamed in a secure way that preserves the extension, it is saved with the new name under the application &quot;uploads&quot; folder, and the new name is stored in the ``db.image.file`` field. This process is designed to prevent directory traversal attacks.

Notice that each field type is rendered by a &#x27;&#x27;widget&#x27;&#x27;. Default widgets can be overridden.

When you click on a table name in **appadmin**, web2py performs a select of all records on the current table, identified by the DAL query
``
db.image.id &gt; 0
``:code

and renders the result.

[[image @///image/en2400.png center 480px]]

You can select a different set of records by editing the DAL query and pressing [Submit].

To edit or delete a single record, click on the record id number.

Because of the ``IS_IN_DB`` validator, the reference field &quot;image_id&quot; is rendered by a drop-down menu. The items in the drop-down are stored as keys (``db.image.id``), but are represented by their ``db.image.title``, as specified by the validator.

Validators are powerful objects that know how to represent fields, filter field values, generate errors, and format values extracted from the field.

The following figure shows what happens when you submit a form that does not pass validation:

[[image @///image/en2500.png center 480px]]

The same forms that are automatically generated by **appadmin** can also be generated programmatically via the ``SQLFORM`` helper and embedded in user applications. These forms are CSS-friendly, and can be customized.

Every application has its own **appadmin**; therefore, **appadmin** itself can be modified without affecting other applications.

So far, the application knows how to store data, and we have seen how to access the database via **appadmin**. Access to **appadmin** is restricted to the administrator, and it is not intended as a production web interface for the application; hence the next part of this walk-through. Specifically we want to create:
- An &quot;index&quot; page that lists all available images sorted by title and links to detail pages for the images.
- A &quot;show/[id]&quot; page that shows the visitor the requested image and allows the visitor to view and post comments.
- A &quot;download/[name]&quot; action to download uploaded images.

This is represented schematically here:

[[yUML diagram @///image/en2600.png center 480px]]

Go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page and edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller, replacing its contents with the following:

``select``:inxx
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
Let&#x27;s edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller and replace its content with:
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
    return dict(images=images)

def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.post.image_id.default = image.id
    form = SQLFORM(db.post)
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = &#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;
    comments = db(db.post.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)

def download():
    return response.download(request, db)
``:code

The controller contains two actions: &quot;show&quot; and &quot;download&quot;.
The &quot;show&quot; action selects the image with the ``id`` parsed from the request args and all comments related to the image. &quot;show&quot; then passes everything to the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

The image id referenced by:
``
URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id)
``:code

in &quot;default/index.html&quot;, can be accessed as:

``request.args(0,cast=int)``

from the &quot;show&quot; action. The ``cast=int`` argument is optional but very important. It attempts to cast the string value passed in the PATH_INFO into an int. On failure it raises a proper exception instead of causing a ticket. One can also specify a redirect in case of failure to cast:

``request.args(0,cast=int,otherwise=URL(&#x27;error&#x27;))``

Moreover ``db.image(...)`` is a shortcut for

``
db(db.image.id==...).select().first()
``:code

The &quot;download&quot; action expects a filename in ``request.args(0)``, builds a path to the location where that file is supposed to be, and sends it back to the client. If the file is too large, it streams the file without incurring any memory overhead.

Notice the following statements:
- Line 7 creates an insert form SQLFORM for the ``db.post`` table using only the specified fields.
- Line 8 sets the value for the reference field, which is not part of the input form because it is not in the list of fields specified above.
- Line 9 processes the submitted form (the submitted form variables are in ``request.vars``) within the current session (the session is used to prevent double submissions, and to enforce navigation). If the submitted form variables are validated, the new comment is inserted in the ``db.post`` table; otherwise the form is modified to include error messages (for example, if the author&#x27;s email address is invalid). This is all done in line 9!.
- Line 10 is only executed if the form is accepted, after the record is inserted into the database table. ``response.flash`` is a web2py variable that is displayed in the views and used to notify the visitor that something happened.
- Line 11 selects all comments that reference the current image.

-------
The &quot;download&quot; action is already defined in the &quot;default.py&quot; controller of the scaffolding application.
-------

The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view. The &quot;show&quot; action, though, should have a view, so return to **admin** and create a new view called &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}

Lines 2-6 provide a comment for the index action. Lines 4-5 inside the comment are interpreted by python as test code (doctest). Tests can be run via the admin interface. In this case the tests verify that the index action runs without errors.

Lines 18, 27, and 35 try to fetch a ``page`` record with the id in
``request.args(0)``.

Lines 13, 20 define and process create forms for a new page and a new comment and

Line 28 defines and processes an update form for a wiki page.

Line 38 creates a ``grid`` object that allows to view, add and update the comments linked to a page.

Some magic happens in line 51. The ``onkeyup`` attribute of the INPUT tag &quot;keyword&quot; is set. Every time the visitor releases a key, the JavaScript code inside the ``onkeyup`` attribute is executed, client-side. Here is the JavaScript code:
``
ajax(&#x27;callback&#x27;, [&#x27;keyword&#x27;], &#x27;target&#x27;);
``:code
``ajax`` is a JavaScript function defined in the file &quot;web2py.js&quot; which is included by the default &quot;layout.html&quot;. It takes three parameters: the URL of the action that performs the synchronous callback, a list of the IDs of variables to be sent to the callback ([&quot;keyword&quot;]), and the ID where the response has to be inserted (&quot;target&quot;).

As soon as you type something in the search box and release a key, the client calls the server and sends the content of the &#x27;keyword&#x27; field, and, when the sever responds, the response is embedded in the page itself as the innerHTML of the &#x27;target&#x27; tag.

The &#x27;target&#x27; tag is a DIV defined in line 52. It could have been defined in the view as well.

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/create.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Create new wiki page&lt;/h1&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

Assuming you are registered and logged in, if you visit the **create** page, you see the following:

[[image @///image/en3500.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/index.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Available wiki pages&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;search&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;search&#x27;))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;{{for page in pages:}}
     {{=LI(A(page.title, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=page.id)))}}
{{pass}}&lt;/ul&gt;
Here is the code for the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;:
[ {{=A(&#x27;edit&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;edit&#x27;, args=request.args))}}
| {{=A(&#x27;documents&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;documents&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
{{for post in comments:}}
  &lt;p&gt;{{=db.auth_user[post.created_by].first_name}} on {{=post.created_on}}
     says &lt;i&gt;{{=post.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

If you wish to use markdown syntax instead of markmin syntax:

``
from gluon.contrib.markdown import WIKI
``:code

and use ``WIKI`` instead of the ``MARKMIN`` helper.
Alternatively, you can choose to accept raw HTML instead of markmin syntax. In this case you would replace:
``
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
``:code

with:
``
{{=XML(page.body)}}
``:code

``sanitize``:inxx
(so that the XML does not get escaped, which web2py normally does by default for security reasons).

This can be done better with:
``
{{=XML(page.body, sanitize=True)}}
``:code

By setting ``sanitize=True``, you tell web2py to escape unsafe XML tags such as &quot;&lt;script&gt;&quot;, and thus prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Now if, from the index page, you click on a page title, you can see the page that you have created:

[[image @///image/en3700.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/edit.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Edit wiki page&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;show&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

It generates a page that looks almost identical to the create page.

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/documents.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Documents for page: {{=page.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;show&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documents&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``:code

If, from the &quot;show&quot; page, you click on documents, you can now manage the documents attached to the page.

[[image @///image/en3800.png center 480px]]

Finally here is the code for the view &quot;default/search.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Search wiki pages&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;listall&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))}}]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=form}}&lt;br /&gt;{{=target_div}}
``:code

which generates the following Ajax search form:

You can also try to call the callback action directly by visiting, for example, the following URL:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/callback?keyword=wiki
``:code

If you look at the page source you see the HTML returned by the callback:
``
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mywiki/default/show/4&quot;&gt;I made a Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

``rss``:inxx
Generating an RSS feed of your wiki pages using web2py is easy because web2py includes ``gluon.contrib.rss2``. Just append the following action to the default controller:
``
def news():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;generates rss feed form the wiki pages&quot;&quot;&quot;
    response.generic_patterns = [&#x27;.rss&#x27;]
    pages = db().select(db.page.ALL, orderby=db.page.title)
    return dict(
       title = &#x27;mywiki rss feed&#x27;,
       link = &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/index&#x27;,
       description = &#x27;mywiki news&#x27;,
       created_on = request.now,
       items = [
          dict(title = row.title,
               link = URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=row.id),
               description = MARKMIN(row.body).xml(),
               created_on = row.created_on
               ) for row in pages])
``:code

and when you visit the page
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/news.rss
``:code

you see the feed (the exact output depends on the feed reader). Notice that the dict is automatically converted to RSS, thanks to the .rss extension in the URL.

[[image @///image/en4000.png center 480px]]

web2py also includes feedparser to read third-party feeds.

``XMLRPC``:inxx
Finally, let&#x27;s add an XML-RPC handler that allows searching the wiki programmatically:
``
service = Service()

@service.xmlrpc
def find_by(keyword):
     &quot;&quot;&quot;finds pages that contain keyword for XML-RPC&quot;&quot;&quot;
     return db(db.page.title.contains(keyword)).select().as_list()

def call():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;exposes all registered services, including XML-RPC&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return service()
``:code

Here, the handler action simply publishes (via XML-RPC), the functions specified in the list. In this case, ``find_by``. ``find_by`` is not an action (because it takes an argument). It queries the database with ``.select()`` and then extracts the records as a list with ``.response`` and returns the list.

Here is an example of how to access the XML-RPC handler from an external
Python program.
``
&gt;&gt;&gt; import xmlrpclib
&gt;&gt;&gt; server = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(
    &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/call/xmlrpc&#x27;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in server.find_by(&#x27;wiki&#x27;):
        print item[&#x27;created_on&#x27;], item[&#x27;title&#x27;]
``:code

The handler can be accessed from many other programming languages that understand XML-RPC, including C, C++, C# and Java.

#### On ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time`` format

There are three different representations for each of the field types ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time``:
- the database representation
- the internal web2py representation
- the string representation in forms and tables

The database representation is an internal issue and does not affect the code. Internally, at the web2py level, they are stored as ``datetime.date``, ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.time`` object respectively and they can be manipulated as such:

``
for page in db(db.page).select():
    print page.title, page.day, page.month, page.year
``

When dates are converted to strings in forms they are converted using the ISO representation
``
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
``

yet this representation is internationalized and you can use the admin translation page to change the format to an alternate one. For example:

``
%m/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S
``

Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications is already written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need to declare that the application&#x27;s current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide an example of the built-in web2py wiki.

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

------
Notice the API of the built-in wiki is still considered experimental and small changes are still possible.
------

Here we assume we are starting from scratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged-in as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is understood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You can make your own view for this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. There is no need to call the action &quot;index&quot;.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you to create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have URLs like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_create
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_search
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_could
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_recent
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_edit/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_editmedia/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_preview/...
``

Try creating more pages such as &quot;index&quot;, &quot;aboutus&quot;, and &quot;contactus&quot;.
Try editing them.


The ``wiki`` method has the following signature:

``
def wiki(self, slug=None, env=None, render=&#x27;markmin&#x27;,
         manage_permissions=False, force_prefix=&#x27;&#x27;,
         restrict_search=False, resolve=True,
         extra=None, menugroups=None)
``:code

It takes the following arguments:

- ``render`` which defaults to ``&#x27;markmin&#x27;`` but can be set equal to ``&#x27;html&#x27;``. It determines the syntax of the wiki. We will discuss the markmin wiki markup later. If you change it to HTML you may want to use a wysiwyg javascript editor such as TinyMCE or NicEdit.
- ``manage_permissions``. This is set to ``False`` by default and only recognizes permissions for &quot;wiki-editor&quot; and &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you change it to ``True`` the create/edit page will give the option to specify by names the group(s) whose members have permission to read and edit the page. In this case is a group &quot;everybody&quot; to give read permission to everybody.
- ``force_prefix``. If set to something like ``&#x27;%(id)s-&#x27;`` it will restrict authors (not editors) to creating pages with a prefix like &quot;[user id]-[page name]&quot;. The prefix can contain the id (&quot;%(id)s&quot;) or the username (&quot;%(username)s&quot;) or any other field from the auth_user table, as long as the corresponding column contains valid string that would pass URL validation.
- ``restrict_search``. This defaults to ``False`` and any logged-in user can search all wiki pages (but not necessary read or edit them). If set to ``True``, authors can search only their own pages, editors can search everything, other users cannot search anything.
- ``menugroups``. This defaults to ``None`` and it indicates that wiki management menu (search, create, edit, etc.) is always displayed. You can set it to a list of group names whose members only can see this menu, for example ``[&#x27;wiki-editor&#x27;,&#x27;wiki-author&#x27;]``. Notice that even if the menu is exposed to everybody that does not mean everybody is allowed to perform actions listed in the menu since they are regulated by the access control system.

The ``wiki`` method has some additional parameters which will be explained later: ``slug``, ``env``, and ``extra``.



#### MARKMIN basics

The MARKMIN syntax allows you to markup **bold** text using ``**bold**``, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27; text with ``&#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;``, ``code`` text with ``\`\`code\`\```. Titles must be prefixed by a #, sections by ##, and sub-sections by ###. Use a minus(-) to prefix an un-ordered item and plus(+) to prefix an ordered item. URLs are automatically converted into links. For example:

``
# This is a title
## this is a section title
### this is a subsection title

Text can be **bold**, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;, !`!!`!code!`!!`! etc.
Learn more at:

http://web2py.com
``:code


You can use the ``extra`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to pass extra rendering rules to the MARKMIN helper.

You can find more information about the MARKMIN syntax in chapter 5.

``auth.wiki`` is more powerful than the barebones MARKMIN helpers, supporting oembed and components.

You can use the ``env`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to expose functions to your wiki.
For example:

``
auth.wiki(env=dict(join=lambda a,b,c:&quot;%s-%s-%s&quot; % (a,b,c)))
``

allows you to use the markup syntax:

``
@(join:1,2,3)
``


This calls the join function passed as extra with parameters ``a,b,c=1,2,3`` and will be rendered as ``1-2-3``.

#### Oembed protocol

You can type in (or cut-and-paste) any URL into a wiki page and it is rendered as a link to the URL. There are exceptions:

- If the URL has an image extension, the link is embedded as an image, ``&lt;img/&gt;``.
- If the URL has an audio extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 audio ``&lt;audio/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a video extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 video ``&lt;video/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a MS Office or PDF extension, Google Doc Viewer is embedded, showing the content of the document (only works for public documents).
- If the URL points to a YouTube page, a Vimeo page, or a Flickr page, web2py contacts the corresponding web service and queries it about the proper way to embed the content. This is done using the ``oembed`` protocol.

Here is a complete list of supported formats:
``
Image (.PNG, .GIF, .JPG, .JPEG)
Audio (.WAV, .OGG, .MP3)
Video (.MOV, .MPE, .MP4, .MPG, .MPG2, .MPEG, .MPEG4, .MOVIE)
``

Supported via Google Doc Viewer:

``
Microsoft Excel (.XLS and .XLSX)
Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 / 2010 (.PPTX)
Apple Pages (.PAGES)
Adobe PDF (.PDF)
Adobe Illustrator (.AI)
Adobe Photoshop (.PSD)
Autodesk AutoCad (.DXF)
Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG)
PostScript (.EPS, .PS)
TrueType (.TTF)
xml Paper Specification (.XPS)
``:code

Supported by oembed:

``
flickr.com
youtube.com
hulu.com
Here ``\@////`` stands for
``:code

but &quot;app&quot;, &quot;controller&quot;, and &quot;function&quot; are omitted thus assuming default.

Similarly you can use the wiki menu to upload a media file (for example an image) linked to the page. The &quot;manage media&quot; page will show all files you have uploaded and will show the proper expression to link the media file. If, for example you upload a file &quot;test.jpg&quot; with title &quot;beach&quot;, the link expression will something like:

``
\@////15/beach.jpg
``:code

``\@////`` is the same prefix described before. ``15`` is the id of the record storing the media file. ``beach`` is the title. ``.jpg`` is the extension of the original file.

If you cut and paste ``\@////15/beach.jpg`` into wiki pages you embed the image.

Mind that media files are linked to pages and inherit access permission from the pages.

#### Wiki menus

If you create a page with slug &quot;wiki-menu&quot; page it will be interpreted as a description of the menu. Here is an example:

``
- Home &gt; \@////index
- Info &gt; \@////info
- web2py &gt; http://google.com
- - About us &gt; \@////aboutus
- - Contact us &gt; \@////contactus
``

Each line a menu item. We used double dash for nested menu items. The ``&gt;`` symbols separates the menu item title from the menu item link.

Mind that the menu is appended to ``response.menu``. It does not replace it. The ``[wiki]`` menu item with service functions is added automatically.

#### Service functions

If, for example, you want to use the wiki to create an editable sidebar you could create a page with ``slug=&quot;sidebar&quot;`` and then embed it in your layout.html with

``
{{=auth.wiki(slug=&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)}}
``:code

Notice that there is nothing special with the word &quot;sidebar&quot;. Any wiki page can be retrieved and embedded at any point in your code. This allows you mix and match wiki functionalities with regular web2py functionalities.

------
Also note that ``auth.wiki(&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)``:code is the same as ``auth.wiki(slug=&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)``:code, since the slug kwarg is the first in the method signature. The former gives a slightly simpler syntax.
------


You can also embed special wiki functions such as the search by tags:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_search&#x27;)}}
``:code

or the tag cloud:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_cloud&#x27;)}}
``:code


#### Extending the auth.wiki feature

When your wiki-enabled app gets more complicated, perhaps you might need to customize the wiki db records managed by the Auth interface or expose customized forms for wiki CRUD tasks. For example, you might want to customize a wiki table record representation or add a new field validator. This is not allowed by default, since the wiki model is defined only after the wiki interface is requested with the auth.wiki() method. To allow access to the wiki specific db setup within the model of your app you must add the following sentence to your model file (i.e. db.py)

``
# Make sure this is called after the auth instance is created
# and before any change to the wiki tables
auth.wiki(resolve=False)
``:code

By using the line above in your model, the wiki tables will be accessible (i.e. ``wiki_page``) for custom CRUD or other db tasks.

------
Note that you still have to call auth.wiki() in the controller or view in order to expose the wiki interface, since the ``resolve=False`` parameter instructs the auth object to just build the wiki model without any other interface setup.
------


Also, by setting resolve to ``False`` in the method call, the wiki tables will be now accessible through the app&#x27;s default db interface at ``&lt;app&gt;/appadmin`` for managing wiki records.


Another customization possible is adding extra fields to the standard wiki tables (in the same way as with the ``auth_user`` table, as described in Chapter 9). Here is how:

``
# Place this after auth object initialization
auth.settings.extra_fields[&quot;wiki_page&quot;] = [Field(&quot;ablob&quot;, &quot;blob&quot;),]
``:code

The line above adds a ``blob`` field to the ``wiki_page`` table. There is no need to call ``auth.wiki(resolve=False)``:code for this option, unless you need access to the wiki model for other customizations.


#### Components

One of the most powerful functions of the new web2py consists in the ability of embedding an action inside another action. We call this a component.

Consider the following model:

``
db.define_table(&#x27;thing&#x27;,Field(&#x27;name&#x27;,requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
``:code

and the following action:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage_things():
    return SQLFORM.grid(db.thing)
``:code

This action is special because it returns a widget/helper not a dict of objects. Now we can embed this ``manage_things`` action into any view, with

``
{{=LOAD(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;manage_things&#x27;,ajax=True)}}
``:code

This allows the visitor interact with the component via Ajax without reloading the host page that embeds the widget. Basically the action is called via Ajax, inherits the style of the host page, and captures all form submissions and flash messages so that they are handled within the current page. On top of this the ``SQLFORM.grid`` widget uses digitally signed URLs to restrict access. More information about components can be found in chapter 13.

Components like the one above can be embedded into wiki pages using the MARKMIN syntax:

``
@{component:default/manage_things}
``

This simply tells web2py that we want to include the &quot;manage_things&quot; action defined in the &quot;default&quot; controller as an Ajax &quot;component&quot;.

---------
Most users will be able to build relatively complex applications simply by using ``auth.wiki`` to create pages and menus and embedded custom components into wiki pages. Wikis can be thought of as a mechanism to allow members of the group to create pages, but they can also be thought of as a way to develop applications in a modular way.
---------

### More on **admin**
``admin``:inxx

The administrative interface provides additional functionality that we briefly review here.

#### Site
``site``:inxx

This page is the main administrative interface of web2py. It lists all installed applications on the left, while on the right side there are some special action forms.

The first of them shows the web2py version and proposes to upgrade it if new versions are available. Of course, before upgrading be sure to have a full working backup!
Then there are two other forms that allow the creation of a new application (simple or by using an online wizard) by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The following form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it (using different names
allows you to install multiple copies of the same application). You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or Instant Press CMS created by Martin Mulone:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or one of the many example applications available at:

``
http://web2py.com/appliances
``

------
Web2py files are packages as ``.w2p`` files. These are tar gzipped files. Web2py uses the ``.w2p`` extension instead of the ``.tgz`` extension to prevent the browser from unzipping on download. They can be uncompressed manually with ``tar zxvf [filename]`` although this is never necessary.
------

[[image @///image/en4100.png center 444px]]

Upon successful upload, web2py displays the MD5 checksum of the uploaded file. You can use it to verify that the file was not corrupted during upload. The InstantPress name will appear in the list of installed applications.

If you run web2py from source and you have ``gitpython`` installed (if necessary, set it up with &#x27;easy_install gitpython&#x27;), you can install applications directly from git repositories
using the ``.git`` URL in the upload form. In this case you will also be enabled to use the admin interface to push changes back into the repository, but this is an experimental feature.

For example, you can locally install the application that shows this book on the web2py site with the URL:

``
https://github.com/mdipierro/web2py-book.git
``

------
That repository hosts the current, updated version of this book (which could be different from the stable version you can see on the web site). You are warmly invited to use it for submitting
improvements, fixes and corrections in the form of pull requests.
------
  
For each application installed you can use the &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page to:
- Go directly to the application by clicking on its name.
- Uninstall the application.
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Clean up temporary files (sessions, errors, and cache.disk files).
- Pack all. This returns a tar file containing a complete copy of the application. We suggest that you clean up temporary files before packing an application.
- Compile the application. If there are no errors, this option will bytecode-compiles all models, controllers and views. Because views can extend and include other views in a tree, before bytecode compilation, the view tree for every controller is collapsed into a single file. The net effect is that a bytecode-compiled application is faster, because there is no more parsing of templates or string substitutions occurring at runtime.
- Pack compiled. This option is only present for bytecode-compiled applications. It allows packing the application without source code for distribution as closed source. Note that Python (as any other programming language) can technically be decompiled; therefore compilation does not provide complete protection of the source code. Nevertheless, de-compilation can be difficult and can be illegal.
- Remove compiled. It simply removes the byte-code compiled models, views and controllers from the application. If the application was packaged with source code or edited locally, there is no harm in removing the bytecode-compiled files, and the application will continue to work. If the application was installed form a packed compiled file, then this is not safe, because there is no source code to revert to, and the application will no longer work.

``admin.py``:inxx

-------
All the functionality available from the web2py admin site page is also accessible programmatically via the API defined in the module ``gluon/admin.py``. Simply open a python shell and import this module.
-------

If the Google App Engine SDK is installer the admin &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page shows a button to push your applications to GAE. If ``python-git`` is installed, there is also a button to push your application to Open Shift. To install applications on ``Heroku`` or other hosting system you should look into the &quot;scripts&quot; folder for the appropriate script.

#### About
``about``:inxx ``license``:inxx

The &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; tab allows editing the description of the application and its license. These are written respectively in the ABOUT and LICENSE files in the application folder.

[[image @///image/en4300.png center 480px]]

You can use ``MARKMIN``, or ``gluon.contrib.markdown.WIKI`` syntax for these files as described in ref.``markdown2``:cite .

#### Design
``EDIT``:inxx
You have used the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page already in this chapter. Here we want to point out a few more functionalities of the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page.
- If you click on any file name, you can see the contents of the file with syntax highlighting.
- If you click on edit, you can edit the file via a web interface.
- If you click on delete, you can delete the file (permanently).
- If you click on test, web2py will run tests. Tests are written by the developer using Python doctests, and each function should have its own tests.
- You can add language files, scan the app to discover all strings, and edit string translations via the web interface.
- If the static files are organized in folders and subfolders, the folder hierarchy can be toggled by clicking on a folder name.

The image below shows the output of the test page for the welcome application.
The image below show the languages tab for the welcome application.
[[image @///image/en4500.png center 480px]]

The image below shows how to edit a language file, in this case the &quot;it&quot; (Italian) language for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4600.png center 480px]]

##### Integrated debugger

&#x27;&#x27;(requires Python 2.6 or later)&#x27;&#x27;

The web2py admin includes a web based debugger. Using the provided web-based editor you can add breakpoints to the Python code and, from the associated debugger console, you can inspect the system variables at those breakpoints and resume execution. This is illustrated in the following screenshot:

[[image @///image/debugger.png center 480px]]

This functionality is based on the Qdb debugger created by Mariano Reingart.
It uses multiprocessing.connection to communicate between the backend
and frontend, with a JSON-RPC-like stream protocol. ``qdb``:cite

##### Shell

If you click on the &quot;shell&quot; link under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27;, web2py will open a web based Python shell and will execute the models for the current application. This allows you to interactively talk to your application.

[[image @///image/en4700.png center 480px]]

-------
Be careful using the web based shell - because different shell requests will be executed in different threads. This easily gives errors, especially if you play with databases
creation and connections. For activities like these (i.e. if you need persistence) it&#x27;s much better to use the python command line.
-------
##### Crontab

Also under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; there is a &quot;crontab&quot; link. By clicking on this link you will be able to edit the web2py crontab file. This follows the same syntax as the Unix crontab but does not rely on Unix. In fact, it only requires web2py, and it works on Windows. It allows you to register actions that need to be executed in background at scheduled times.
For more information about this, see the next chapter.

#### Errors
``errors``:inxx

When programming web2py, you will inevitably make mistakes and introduce bugs. web2py helps in two ways: 1) it allows you to create tests for every function that can be run in the browser from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page; and 2) when an error manifests itself, a ticket is issued to the visitor and the error is logged.

Intentionally introduce an error in the images application as shown below:
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL,orderby=db.image.title)
    1/0
    return dict(images=images)
``:code

When you access the index action, you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en4800.png center 480px]]

Only the administrator can access the ticket:

[[image @///image/en4900.png center 480px]]

The ticket shows the traceback, and the content of the file that caused the problem, and the complete state of system (variables, request, session, etc.) If the error occurs in a view, web2py shows the view converted from HTML into Python code. This allows to easily identify the logical structure of the file.

By default tickets are stored on filesystem and displayed grouped by traceback. The administrative interface provides an aggregate views (type of traceback and number of occurrence) and a detailed view (all tickets are listed by ticket id). The administrator can switch between the two views.

Notice that everywhere **admin** shows syntax-highlighted code (for example, in error reports, web2py keywords are shown in orange). If you click on a web2py keyword, you are redirected to a documentation page about the keyword.

If you fix the divide-by-zero bug in the index action and introduce one in the index view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}

&lt;h1&gt;Current Images&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{{for image in images:}}
{{1/0}}
{{=LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&quot;show&quot;, args=image.id)))}}
{{pass}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en5000.png center 480px]]

Note that web2py has converted the view from HTML into a Python file, and the error described in the ticket refers to the generated Python code and NOT to the original view file:

[[image @///image/en5100.png center 480px]]

This may seem confusing at first, but in practice it makes debugging easier, because the Python indentation highlights the logical structure of the code that you embedded in the views.

The code is shown at the bottom of the same page.

All tickets are listed under admin in the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page for each application:

You can access the wizard from the &quot;sites&quot; page as shown in the image below.
The wizard will guide you through a series of steps involved in creating a new application:

- Chose a name for the application
- Configure the application and choose required plugins
- Build required models (it will create CRUD pages for each model)
- Allow you to edit the views of those pages using MARKMIN syntax

The image below shows the second step of the process.

[[image @///image/en5500.png center 480px]]

You can see a dropdown to select a layout plugin (from ``web2py.com/layouts``), a multiple choice dropdown to check other plugins (from ``web2py.com/plugins``) and a &quot;login config&quot; field where to put the Janrain &quot;domain:key&quot;.

The other steps are pretty much self-explanatory.

The Wizard works well for what it does but it is considered an &#x27;&#x27;experimental feature&#x27;&#x27; for two reasons:

- Applications created with the wizard and edited manually, cannot later be modified by the wizard.
- The interface of the wizard will change over time to include support for more features and easier visual development.

In any case the wizard is a handy tool for fast prototyping and it can be used to bootstrap a new application with an alternate layout and optional plugins.

#### Configuring **admin**

Normally there is no need to perform any configuration of admin but a few customizations are possible. After you login into admin you can edit the admin configuration file via the URL:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/edit/admin/models/0.py
``
Notice that **admin** can be used to edit itself. In fact **admin** is an app as any other one.

The file &quot;0.py&quot; is very much self documented and if you are opening probably you already know what you are looking for. Anyway a few customizations exist that are more important than others:

``
GAE_APPCFG = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(&#x27;/usr/local/bin/appcfg.py&#x27;))
``
This should point to the location of the &quot;appcfg.py&quot; file that comes with the Google App Engine SDK. If you have the SDK you may want to change these config parameters to the correct value. It will allow you to deploy to GAE from the admin interface.

``DEMO_MODE``:inxx

You can also set web2py admin in demo mode:
``
DEMO_MODE = True
FILTER_APPS = [&#x27;welcome&#x27;]
``
And only the apps listed in filter apps will be accessible and they will be only accessible in read-only mode.

``MULTI_USER_MODE``:inxx
``virtual laboratory``:inxx

If you are a teacher and want to expose the administrative interface to students so that students can share one administrative interface for their projects (think of a virtual lab), can do it by setting:
``
MULTI_USER_MODE = True
``
In this way students will be required to login and will only be able to access their own apps via admin. You, as first user/teacher, will be able to access them all.

In multi user mode, you can register students using the &quot;bulk register&quot; link in admin and manage them using the &quot;manage students&quot; link. The system also keeps track of when students login and how many lines of code they add/remove to/from their code. This data is presented to the administrator as charts under the application &quot;about&quot; page.

Mind that this mechanism still assumes all users are trusted. All the apps created under admin run under the same credentials on the same filesystem. It is possible for an app created by a student to access the data and the source of an app created by another student. It is also possible for a student to create an app that locks the server.

#### Mobile **admin**

Notice that the admin application includes &quot;plugin_jqmobile&quot; which packages jQuery Mobile. When admin is accessed from a mobile device; this is detected by web2py and the interface is displayed using a mobile-friendly layout.

### More on **appadmin**

``appadmin``:inxx

**appadmin** is not intended to be exposed to the public. It is designed to help you by providing an easy access to the database. It consists of only two files: a controller &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and a view &quot;appadmin.html&quot; which are used by all actions in the controller.

The **appadmin** controller is relatively small and readable; it provides an example of designing a database interface.

**appadmin** shows which databases are available and which tables exist in each database. You can insert records and list all records for each table individually. **appadmin** paginates output 100 records at a time.

Once a set of records is selected, the header of the pages changes, allowing you to update or delete the selected records.

To update the records, enter an SQL assignment in the Query string field:
``
title = &#x27;test&#x27;
``:code

where string values must be enclosed in single quotes. Multiple fields can be separated by commas.

To delete a record, click the corresponding checkbox to confirm that you are sure.

**appadmin** can also perform joins if the SQL FILTER contains a SQL condition that involves two or more tables. For example, try:
``
db.image.id == db.post.image_id
``:code

web2py passes this along to the DAL, and it understands that the query links two tables; hence, both tables are selected with an INNER JOIN. Here is the output:

[[image @///image/en5600.png center 480px]]

If you click on the number of an id field, you get an edit page for the record with the corresponding id.

If you click on the number of a reference field, you get an edit page for the referenced record.

You cannot update or delete rows selected by a join, because they involve records from multiple tables and this would be ambiguous.

In addition to its database administration capabilities, **appadmin** also enables you to view details about the contents of the application&#x27;s ``cache`` (at ``/yourapp/appadmin/cache``) as well as the contents of the current ``request``, ``response``, and ``session`` objects (at ``/yourapp/appadmin/state``).
</pre></div>
    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #F2DEDE;">-----
When you create a new application using **admin**, it starts as a clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; scaffolding app with a &quot;models/db.py&quot; that creates a SQLite database, connects to it, instantiates Auth, Crud, and Service, configures them. It also provides a &quot;controller/default.py&quot; which exposes actions &quot;index&quot;, &quot;download&quot;, &quot;user&quot; for user management, and &quot;call&quot; for services. In the following, we assume that these files have been removed; we will be creating apps from scratch.
-----

web2py also comes with a **wizard**, described later in this chapter, that can write an alternate scaffolding code for you based on layouts and plugins available on the web and based on high level description of the models.

### Simple examples

#### Say hello
``index``:inxx

Here, as an example, we create a simple web app that displays the message &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot; to the user. We will call this application &quot;myapp&quot;. We will also add a counter that counts how many times the same user visits the page.

You can create a new application simply by typing its name in the form on the top right of the **site** page in **admin**.

[[image @///image/en800.png center 447px]]

After you press [create], the application is created as a copy of the built-in welcome application.

[[image @///image/en900.png center 480px]]

To run the new application, visit:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp
``:code

Now you have a copy of the welcome application.

To edit an application, click on the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; button for the newly created application.

The **edit** page tells you what is inside the application.
Every web2py application consists of certain files, most of which fall into one of six categories:
- **models**: describe the data representation.
- **controllers**: describe the application logic and workflow.
- **views**: describe the data presentation.
- **languages**: describe how to translate the application presentation to other languages.
- **modules**: Python modules that belong to the application.
- **static files**: static images, CSS  files``css-w,css-o,css-school``:cite , JavaScript files``js-w,js-b``:cite , etc.
- **plugins**: groups of files designed to work together.

Everything is neatly organized following the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Each section in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page corresponds to a subfolder in the application folder.

Notice that section headings will toggle their content. Folder names under static files are also collapsible.

-------
Each file listed in the section corresponds to a file physically located in the subfolder. Any operation performed on a file via the **admin** interface (create, edit, delete) can be performed directly from the shell using your favorite editor.
-------

The application contains other types of files (database, session files, error files, etc.), but they are not listed on the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page because they are not created or modified by the administrator; they are created and modified by the application itself.

The controllers contain the logic and workflow of the application. Every URL gets mapped into a call to one of the functions in the controllers (actions). There are two default controllers: &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and &quot;default.py&quot;. **appadmin** provides the database administrative interface; we do not need it now. &quot;default.py&quot; is the controller that you need to edit, the one that is called by default when no controller is specified in the URL. Edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def index():
    return &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;
``:code

Here is what the online editor looks like:

[[image @///image/en1000.png center 480px]]

Save it and go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. Click on the index link to visit the newly created page.

When you visit the URL
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/default/index
``:code

the index action in the default controller of the myapp application is called. It returns a string that the browser displays for us. It should look like this:

[[image @///image/en1100.png center 480px]]

Now, edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def first():

The ``form`` object can be easily serialized in HTML by embedding it in the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view.
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=form}}
``:code

The ``form.process()`` method applies the validators and returns the form itself. The ``form.accepted`` variable is set to True if the form was processed and passed validation. If the self-submitted form passes validation, it stores the variables in the session and redirects as before. If the form does not pass validation, error messages are inserted into the form and shown to the user, as below:

[[image @///image/en1800.png center 480px]]

In the next section we will show how forms can be generated automatically from a model.

In all or examples we have used the session to pass the user name from the first action to the second. We could have used a different mechanism and pass data as part of a redirect URL:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;,vars=dict(name=name)))
    return dict(form=form)

def second():
    name = request.vars.visitor_name or redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
    return dict(name=name)
``:code

#### Internationalization

You code is likely to include hardcoded strings such as &quot;What is your name?&quot;. You should be able to customize strings without editing the code and in particular insert translations for these strings in different languages. In this way if a visitor has the language preference of the browser set to &quot;Italian&quot;, web2py will use the Italian translation for the strings, if available. This feature of web2py is called &quot;internationalization&quot; and it is described in more detail in the next chapter.

Here we just observe that in order to use this feature you should markup strings that needs translation. This is done by wrapping a a quoted string in code such as

``
&quot;What is your name?&quot;
``:code

with the ``T`` operator:

``
T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)
``:code


You can also mark fo translations strings hardcoded in views. For example

``
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

becomes

``
&lt;h1&gt;{{=T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

It is good practice to do this for every string in the code (field labels, flash messages, etc.) except for tables and field names.

Once the strings are identified and marked up, web2py takes care of almost everything else. The admin interface also provides a page where you can translate each string in the languages you desire to support.

### An image blog
``upload``:inxx

Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments (posts).

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;post&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;email&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;))

db.image.title.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)
db.post.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
db.post.author.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()
db.post.email.requires = IS_EMAIL()
db.post.body.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()

db.post.image_id.writable = db.post.image_id.readable = False
``:code

Let&#x27;s analyze this line by line.

Line 1 defines a global variable called ``db`` that represents the database connection. In this case it is a connection to a SQLite database stored in the file  &quot;applications/images/databases/storage.sqlite&quot;. In the SQLite case, if the database does not exist, it is created. You can change the name of the file, as well as the name of the global variable ``db``, but it is convenient to give them the same name, to make it easy to remember.

Lines 3-5 define a table &quot;image&quot;. ``define_table`` is a method of the ``db`` object. The first argument, &quot;image&quot;, is the name of the table we are defining. The other arguments are the fields belonging to that table. This table has a field called &quot;title&quot;, a field called &quot;file&quot;, and a field called &quot;id&quot; that serves as the table primary key (&quot;id&quot; is not explicitly declared because all tables have an id field by default). The field &quot;title&quot; is a string, and the field &quot;file&quot; is of type &quot;upload&quot;. &quot;upload&quot; is a special type of field used by the web2py Data Abstraction Layer (DAL) to store the names of uploaded files. web2py knows how to upload files (via streaming if they are large), rename them safely, and store them.

When a table is defined, web2py takes one of several possible actions:
- if the table does not exist, the table is created;
- if the table exists and does not correspond to the definition, the table is altered accordingly, and if a field has a different type, web2py tries to convert its contents;
- if the table exists and corresponds to the definition, web2py does nothing.

This behavior is called &quot;migration&quot;. In web2py migrations are automatic, but can be disabled for each table by passing ``migrate=False`` as the last argument of ``define_table``.

Line 6 defines a format string for the table. It determines how a record should be represented as a string. Notice that the ``format`` argument can also be a function that takes a record and returns a string. For example:

``
format=lambda row: row.title
``:code

Lines 8-12 define another table called &quot;post&quot;.
A post has an &quot;author&quot;, an &quot;email&quot; (we intend to store the email address of the author of the post), a &quot;body&quot; of type &quot;text&quot; (we intend to use it to store the actual comment posted by the author), and an &quot;image_id&quot; field of type reference that points to ``db.image`` via the &quot;id&quot; field.

In line 14, ``db.image.title`` represents the field &quot;title&quot; of table &quot;image&quot;. The attribute ``requires`` allows you to set requirements/constraints that will be enforced by web2py forms. Here we require that the &quot;title&quot; is unique:

``IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)``:code

&#x27;&#x27;Notice this is optional because it is set automatically given that ``Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True)``&#x27;&#x27;.

The objects representing these constraints are called validators. Multiple validators can be grouped in a list. Validators are executed in the order they appear.
``IS_NOT_IN_DB(a, b)`` is a special validator that checks that the value of a field ``b`` for a new record is not already in ``a``.

Line 15 requires that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;post&quot; is in ``db.image.id``. As far as the database is concerned, we had already declared this  when we defined the table &quot;post&quot;.
Now we are explicitly telling the model that this condition should be enforced by web2py, too, at the form processing level when a new comment is posted, so that invalid values do not propagate from input forms to the database. We also require that the &quot;image_id&quot; be represented by the &quot;title&quot;, ``&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;``, of the corresponding record.

Line 20 indicates that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;post&quot; should not be shown in forms, ``writable=False`` and not even in readonly forms, ``readable=False``.

The meaning of the validators in lines 15-17 should be obvious.

``format``:inxx
Notice that the validator
``
db.post.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

can be omitted (and would be automatic) if we specify a format for referenced table:
``
db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;, ..., format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

where the format can be a string or a function that takes a record and returns a string.

``appadmin``:inxx
Once a model is defined, if there are no errors, web2py creates an application administration interface to manage the database. You access it via the &quot;database administration&quot; link in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page or directly:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/appadmin
``:code

Here is a screenshot of the **appadmin** interface:

[[image @///image/en2100.png center 480px]]

This interface is coded in the controller called &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and the corresponding view &quot;appadmin.html&quot;. From now on, we will refer to this interface simply as **appadmin**. It allows the administrator to insert new database records, edit and delete existing records, browse tables, and perform database joins.

The first time **appadmin** is accessed, the model is executed and the tables are created. The web2py DAL translates Python code into SQL statements that are specific to the selected database back-end (SQLite in this example). You can see the generated SQL from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page by clicking on the &quot;sql.log&quot; link under &quot;models&quot;. Notice that the link is not present until the tables have been created.

[[image @///image/en2200.png center 480px]]

If you were to edit the model and access **appadmin** again, web2py would generate SQL to alter the existing tables. The generated SQL is logged into &quot;sql.log&quot;.

Now go back to **appadmin** and try to insert a new image record:

[[image @///image/en2300.png center 480px]]

web2py has translated the ``db.image.file`` &quot;upload&quot; field into an upload form for the file. When the form is submitted and an image file is uploaded, the file is renamed in a secure way that preserves the extension, it is saved with the new name under the application &quot;uploads&quot; folder, and the new name is stored in the ``db.image.file`` field. This process is designed to prevent directory traversal attacks.

Notice that each field type is rendered by a &#x27;&#x27;widget&#x27;&#x27;. Default widgets can be overridden.

When you click on a table name in **appadmin**, web2py performs a select of all records on the current table, identified by the DAL query
``
db.image.id &gt; 0
``:code

and renders the result.

[[image @///image/en2400.png center 480px]]

You can select a different set of records by editing the SQL query and pressing [Submit].

To edit or delete a single record, click on the record id number.

Because of the ``IS_IN_DB`` validator, the reference field &quot;image_id&quot; is rendered by a drop-down menu. The items in the drop-down are stored as keys (``db.image.id``), but are represented by their ``db.image.title``, as specified by the validator.

Validators are powerful objects that know how to represent fields, filter field values, generate errors, and format values extracted from the field.

The following figure shows what happens when you submit a form that does not pass validation:

[[image @///image/en2500.png center 480px]]

The same forms that are automatically generated by **appadmin** can also be generated programmatically via the ``SQLFORM`` helper and embedded in user applications. These forms are CSS-friendly, and can be customized.

Every application has its own **appadmin**; therefore, **appadmin** itself can be modified without affecting other applications.

So far, the application knows how to store data, and we have seen how to access the database via **appadmin**. Access to **appadmin** is restricted to the administrator, and it is not intended as a production web interface for the application; hence the next part of this walk-through. Specifically we want to create:
- An &quot;index&quot; page that lists all available images sorted by title and links to detail pages for the images.
- A &quot;show/[id]&quot; page that shows the visitor the requested image and allows the visitor to view and post comments.
- A &quot;download/[name]&quot; action to download uploaded images.

This is represented schematically here:

[[yUML diagram @///image/en2600.png center 480px]]

Go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page and edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller, replacing its contents with the following:

``select``:inxx
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
Let&#x27;s edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller and replace its content with:
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
    return dict(images=images)

def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.post.image_id.default = image.id
    form = SQLFORM(db.post)
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = &#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;
    comments = db(db.post.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)

def download():
    return response.download(request, db)
``:code

The controller contains two actions: &quot;show&quot; and &quot;download&quot;.
The &quot;show&quot; action selects the image with the ``id`` parsed from the request args and all comments related to the image. &quot;show&quot; then passes everything to the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

The image id referenced by:
``
URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id)
``:code

in &quot;default/index.html&quot;, can be accessed as:

``request.args(0,cast=int)``

from the &quot;show&quot; action. The ``cast=int`` argument is optional but very important. It attempts to cast the string value passed in the PATH_INFO into an int. On failure it raise a proper exception instead of causing a ticket. One can also specify a redirect in case of failure to cast:

``request.args(0,cast=int,otherwise=URL(&#x27;error&#x27;))``

Moreover ``db.image(...)`` is a shortcut for

``
db(db.image.id==...).select().first()
``:code

The &quot;download&quot; action expects a filename in ``request.args(0)``, builds a path to the location where that file is supposed to be, and sends it back to the client. If the file is too large, it streams the file without incurring any memory overhead.

Notice the following statements:
- Line 7 creates an insert form SQLFORM for the ``db.post`` table using only the specified fields.
- Line 8 sets the value for the reference field, which is not part of the input form because it is not in the list of fields specified above.
- Line 9 processes the submitted form (the submitted form variables are in ``request.vars``) within the current session (the session is used to prevent double submissions, and to enforce navigation). If the submitted form variables are validated, the new comment is inserted in the ``db.post`` table; otherwise the form is modified to include error messages (for example, if the author&#x27;s email address is invalid). This is all done in line 9!.
- Line 10 is only executed if the form is accepted, after the record is inserted into the database table. ``response.flash`` is a web2py variable that is displayed in the views and used to notify the visitor that something happened.
- Line 11 selects all comments that reference the current image.

-------
The &quot;download&quot; action is already defined in the &quot;default.py&quot; controller of the scaffolding application.
-------

The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view. The &quot;show&quot; action, though, should have a view, so return to **admin** and create a new view called &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;

``:code

Edit the controller &quot;default.py&quot; and create the following actions:
- index: list all wiki pages
- create: post another wiki page
- show: show a wiki page and its comments, and append comments
- edit: edit an existing page
- documents: manage the documents attached to a page
- download: download a document (as in the images example)
- search: display a search box and, via an Ajax callback, return all matching titles as the visitor types
- callback: the Ajax callback function. It returns the HTML that gets embedded in the search page while the visitor types.

``:code


Lines 2-6 provide a comment for the index action. Lines 4-5 inside the comment are interpreted by python as test code (doctest). Tests can be run via the admin interface. In this case the tests verify that the index action runs without errors.

Lines 18, 27, and 35 try to fetch a ``page`` record with the id in
``request.args(0)``.

Lines 13, 20 define and process create forms for a new page and a new comment and.

Line 28 defines and processes an update form for a wiki page.

Line 38 creates a ``grid`` object that allows to browser, add and update the comments linked to a page.

Some magic happens in line 51. The ``onkeyup`` attribute of the INPUT tag &quot;keyword&quot; is set. Every time the visitor releases a key, the JavaScript code inside the ``onkeyup`` attribute is executed, client-side. Here is the JavaScript code:
``
ajax(&#x27;callback&#x27;, [&#x27;keyword&#x27;], &#x27;target&#x27;);
``:code
``ajax`` is a JavaScript function defined in the file &quot;web2py.js&quot; which is included by the default &quot;layout.html&quot;. It takes three parameters: the URL of the action that performs the synchronous callback, a list of the IDs of variables to be sent to the callback ([&quot;keyword&quot;]), and the ID where the response has to be inserted (&quot;target&quot;).

As soon as you type something in the search box and release a key, the client calls the server and sends the content of the &#x27;keyword&#x27; field, and, when the sever responds, the response is embedded in the page itself as the innerHTML of the &#x27;target&#x27; tag.

The &#x27;target&#x27; tag is a DIV defined in line 52. It could have been defined in the view as well.

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/create.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Create new wiki page&lt;/h1&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

Assuming you are registered and logged in, if you visit the **create** page, you see the following:

[[image @///image/en3500.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/index.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Available wiki pages&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;search&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;search&#x27;))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;{{for page in pages:}}
     {{=LI(A(page.title, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=page.id)))}}
{{pass}}&lt;/ul&gt;
Here is the code for the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;:
[ {{=A(&#x27;edit&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;edit&#x27;, args=request.args))}}
| {{=A(&#x27;documents&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;documents&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
{{for post in comments:}}
  &lt;p&gt;{{=db.auth_user[post.created_by].first_name}} on {{=post.created_on}}
     says &lt;i&gt;{{=post.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

If you wish to use markdown syntax instead of markmin syntax:

``
from gluon.contrib.markdown import WIKI
``:code

and use ``WIKI`` instead of the ``MARKMIN`` helper.
Alternatively, you can choose to accept raw HTML instead of markmin syntax. In this case you would replace:
``
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
``:code

with:
``
{{=XML(page.body)}}
``:code

``sanitize``:inxx
(so that the XML does not get escaped, as by default web2py behavior).

This can be done better with:
``
{{=XML(page.body, sanitize=True)}}
``:code

By setting ``sanitize=True``, you tell web2py to escape unsafe XML tags such as &quot;&lt;script&gt;&quot;, and thus prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Now if, from the index page, you click on a page title, you can see the page that you have created:

[[image @///image/en3700.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/edit.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Edit wiki page&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;show&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

It generates a page that looks almost identical to the create page.

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/documents.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Documents for page: {{=page.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;show&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documents&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``:code

If, from the &quot;show&quot; page, you click on documents, you can now manage the documents attached to the page.

[[image @///image/en3800.png center 480px]]

Finally here is the code for the view &quot;default/search.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Search wiki pages&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;listall&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))}}]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=form}}&lt;br /&gt;{{=target_div}}
``:code

which generates the following Ajax search form:

[[image @///image/en3900.png center 480px]]

You can also try to call the callback action directly by visiting, for example, the following URL:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/callback?keyword=wiki
``:code

If you look at the page source you see the HTML returned by the callback:
``
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mywiki/default/show/4&quot;&gt;I made a Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

``rss``:inxx
Generating an RSS feed from the stored pages using web2py is easy because web2py includes ``gluon.contrib.rss2``. Just append the following action to the default controller:
``
def news():
    &quot;generates rss feed form the wiki pages&quot;
    response.generic_patterns = [&#x27;.rss&#x27;]
    pages = db().select(db.page.ALL, orderby=db.page.title)
    return dict(
       title = &#x27;mywiki rss feed&#x27;,
       link = &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/index&#x27;,
       description = &#x27;mywiki news&#x27;,
       created_on = request.now,
       items = [
          dict(title = row.title,
               link = URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=row.id),
               description = MARKMIN(row.body).xml(),
               created_on = row.created_on
               ) for row in pages])
``:code

and when you visit the page
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/news.rss
``:code

you see the feed (the exact output depends on the feed reader). Notice that the dict is automatically converted to RSS, thanks to the .rss extension in the URL.

[[image @///image/en4000.png center 480px]]

web2py also includes feedparser to read third-party feeds.

``XMLRPC``:inxx
Finally, let&#x27;s add an XML-RPC handler that allows searching the wiki programmatically:
``
service = Service()

@service.xmlrpc
def find_by(keyword):
     &quot;finds pages that contain keyword for XML-RPC&quot;
     return db(db.page.title.contains(keyword)).select().as_list()

def call():
    &quot;exposes all registered services, including XML-RPC&quot;
    return service()
``:code

Here, the handler action simply publishes (via XML-RPC), the functions specified in the list. In this case, ``find_by``. ``find_by`` is not an action (because it takes an argument). It queries the database with ``.select()`` and then extracts the records as a list with ``.response`` and returns the list.

Here is an example of how to access the XML-RPC handler from an external
Python program.
``
&gt;&gt;&gt; import xmlrpclib
&gt;&gt;&gt; server = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(
    &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/call/xmlrpc&#x27;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in server.find_by(&#x27;wiki&#x27;):
        print item[&#x27;created_on&#x27;], item[&#x27;title&#x27;]
``:code

The handler can be accessed from many other programming languages that understand XML-RPC, including C, C++, C# and Java.

#### On ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time`` format

There are three different representation for each of the field types ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time``:
- the database representation
- the internal web2py prepresentation
- the string representation in forms and tables

The database representation is an internal issue and does not affect the code. Internally, at the web2py level, they are stored as ``datetime.date``, ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.time`` object respectively and they can be manipulated as such:

``
for page in db(db.page).select():
    print page.title, page.day, page.month, page.year
``

When dates are converted to strings in forms they are converted using the ISO representation
``
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
``

yet this representation in internationalized and you can use the admin stranslation page to change the format to an alternate one. For example:

``
%m/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S
``

Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications is already written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need declare that the application current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide and example of the built-in web2py wiki.

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

------
Notice the API of the built-in wiki are still considered experimental and small changes are still possible.
------

Here we assume we are starting from scratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is understood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You man make your own view for this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. There is no need to call the action &quot;index&quot;.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have RULS like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_create
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_search
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_could
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_recent
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_edit/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_editmedia/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_preview/...
``

Try create more pages such as &quot;index&quot;, &quot;aboutus&quot;, and &quot;contactus&quot;.
Try edit them.


The ``wiki`` method has the following signature:

``
def wiki(self, slug=None, env=None, render=&#x27;markmin&#x27;,
         manage_permissions=False, force_prefix=&#x27;&#x27;,
         restrict_search=False, resolve=True,
         extra=None, menugroups=None)
``:code

It takes the following arguments:

- ``render`` which defaults to ``&#x27;markmin&#x27;`` but can be set equal to ``&#x27;html&#x27;``. It termines the syntax of the wiki. We will discuss the markmin wiki markup later. If you change it to HTML you may want to use a wysiwyg javascript editor such as TinyMCE of NicEdit.
- ``manage_permissions``. This is set to ``False`` by default and only recognizes permissions for &quot;wiki-editor&quot; and &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you change it to ``True`` the create/edit page will give the option to specify by names the groups whose members have permission to read and edit the page. In this case is a group &quot;everybody&quot; to give read permission to everybody.
- ``force_prefix``. If set to something like ``&#x27;%(id)s-&#x27;`` it will restrict authors (not editors) to create page with a prefix like &quot;[user id]-[page name]&quot;. The prefix can contain the id (&quot;%(id)s&quot;) or the username (&quot;%(username)s&quot;) or any other field from the auth_user table, as long as the corresponding column contains valid string that would pass URL validation.
- ``restrict_search``. This default to ``False`` and any logged-in user can search all wiki pages (but not necessary read or edit them). If set to ``True``, authors can search only their own pages, editors can search everything, other users cannot search anything.
- ``menugroups``. This defaults to ``None`` and it indicates that wiki management menu (search, create, edit, etc.) is always displayed. You can set it to a list of group names whose members only can see this menu, for example ``[&#x27;wiki-editor&#x27;,&#x27;wiki-author&#x27;]``. Notice that even if the menu is exposed to everybody does not mean everybody is allowed to perform actions listed in the menu since they are regulated by the access control system.

The ``wiki`` method has some additional parameters which will be explained later: ``slug``, ``env``, and ``extra``.



#### MARKMIN basics

The MARKMIN syntax allows you to markup **bold** text using ``**bold**``, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27; text with ``&#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;``, ``code`` text with ``\`\`code\`\```. Titles must be prefixed by a #, sections by ##, and sub-sections by ###. Use a minus(-) to prefix an un-ordered item and plus(+) to prefix an ordered item. URLs are automatically into links. For example:

``
# This is title
## this is a section title
### this is a subsection title

Text can be **bold**, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;, !`!!`!code!`!!`! etc.
Learn more at:

http://web2py.com
``:code


You can use the ``extra`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to pass extra rendering rules to the MARKMIN helper.

You can find more information about the MARKMIN syntax in chapter 5.

``auth.wiki`` is more powerful than the barebones MARKMIN helpers, supporting oembed and components.

You can use theS ``env`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to expose functions to your wiki.
For example:

``
auth.wiki(env=dict(join=lambda a,b,c:&quot;%s-%s-%s&quot; % (a,b,c)))
``

allows you to use the markup syntax:

``
@(join:1,2,3)
``


This call the join function passed as extra with parameters ``a,b,c=1,2,3`` and will be rendered as ``1-2-3``.

#### Oembed protocol

You can type in (or cut-and-paste) any URL into a wiki page it normally is rendered as a link to the URL. There are exceptions:

- If the URL has an image extension, the link is embedded as an image, ``&lt;img/&gt;``.
- If the URL has an audio extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 audio ``&lt;audio/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a video extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 video ``&lt;video/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a MS Office or PDF extension, Google Doc Viewer is embedded, showing the content of the document (only works for public documents).
- If the URL points to a Youtube page, a Vimeo page, or a Flickr page, web2py contacts the corresponding web service and queries it about the proper way to embed the content. This is done using the ``oembed`` protocol.

Here is a complete list of supported formats:
``
Image (.PNG, .GIF, .JPG, .JPEG)
Audio (.WAV, .OGG, .MP3)
Video (.MOV, .MPE, .MP4, .MPG, .MPG2, .MPEG, .MPEG4, .MOVIE)
``

Supported via Google Doc Viewer:

``
Microsoft Excel (.XLS and .XLSX)
Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 / 2010 (.PPTX)
Apple Pages (.PAGES)
Adobe PDF (.PDF)
Adobe Illustrator (.AI)
Adobe Photoshop (.PSD)
Autodesk AutoCad (.DXF)
Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG)
PostScript (.EPS, .PS)
TrueType (.TTF)
xml Paper Specification (.XPS)
``:code

Supported by oembed:

``
flickr.com
youtube.com
hulu.com
Here ``\@////`` stands for
``:code

but &quot;app&quot;, &quot;controller&quot;, and &quot;function&quot; are omitted thus assuming default.

Similarly you can use the wiki menu to upload a media file (for example an image) linked to the page. The &quot;manage media&quot; page will show all files you have uploaded and will show the proper expression to link the media file. If, for example you upload a file &quot;test.jpg&quot; with title &quot;beach&quot;, the link expression will something like:

``
\@////15/beach.jpg
``:code

``\@////`` is the same prefix described before. ``15`` is the id of the record storing the media file. ``beach`` is the title. ``.jpg`` is the extension of the original file.

If you cut and paste ``\@////15/beach.jpg`` into wiki pages you embed the image.

Mind that media files are linked to pages and inherit access permission from the pages.

#### Wiki menus

If you create a page with slug &quot;wiki-menu&quot; page it will be interpreted as a description of the menu. Here is an example:

``
- Home &gt; \@////index
- Info &gt; \@////info
- web2py &gt; http://google.com
- - About us &gt; \@////aboutus
- - Contact us &gt; \@////contactus
``

Each line a menu item. We used double dash for nested menu items. The ``&gt;`` symbols separates the menu item title from the menu item link.

Mind that the menu is appended to ``response.menu``. It does not replace it. The ``[wiki]`` menu tem with service functions is added automatically.

#### Service functions

If, for example, you want to use the wiki to create an editable sidebar you could create a page with ``slug=&quot;sidebar&quot;`` and then embed it in your layout.html with

``
{{=auth.wiki(slug=&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)}}
``:code

Notice that there is nothing special with the word &quot;sidebar&quot;. Any wiki page can be retrieved and embedded in any point in your code. This allows you mix and match wiki functionalities with regular web2py functionalities.

------
Also note that ``auth.wiki(&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)``:code is the same as ``auth.wiki(slug=&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)``:code, since the slug kwarg is the first in the method signature. The former gives a slightly simpler syntax.
------


You can also embed special wiki functions as the search by tags:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_search&#x27;)}}
``:code

or the tag cloud:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_cloud&#x27;)}}
``:code


#### Extending the auth.wiki feature

When your wiki-enabled app gets more complicated, perhaps you might need to customize the wiki db records managed by the Auth interface or expose customized forms for wiki CRUD tasks. For example, you might want to customize a wiki table record representation or add a new field validator. This is not allowed by default, since the wiki model is defined only after the wiki interface is requested with the auth.wiki() method. To allow access to the wiki specific db setup within the model of your app you must add the following sentence to your model file (i.e. db.py)

``
# Make sure this is called after the auth instance is created
# and before any change to the wiki tables
auth.wiki(resolve=False)
``:code

By using the line above in your model, the wiki tables will be accessible (i.e. ``wiki_page``) for custom CRUD or other db tasks.

------
Note that you still have to call auth.wiki() in the controller or view in order to expose the wiki interface, since the ``resolve=False`` parameter instructs the auth object to just build the wiki model without any other interface setup.
------


Also, by setting resolve to ``False`` in the method call, the wiki tables will be now accesible trough the app&#x27;s default db interface at ``&lt;app&gt;/appadmin`` for managing wiki records.


Another customization possible is adding extra fields to the standard wiki tables (in the same way as with the ``auth_user`` table, as described in Chapter 9). Here is how:

``
# Place this after auth object initialization
auth.settings.extra_fields[&quot;wiki_page&quot;] = [Field(&quot;ablob&quot;, &quot;blob&quot;),]
``:code

The line above adds a ``blob`` field to the ``wiki_page`` table. There is no need to call ``auth.wiki(resolve=False)``:code for this option, unless you need access to the wiki model for other customizations.


#### Components

One of the most powerful function of the new web2py consists in the ability of embedding an action inside another action. We call this a component.

Consider the following model:

``
db.define_table(&#x27;thing&#x27;,Field(&#x27;name&#x27;,requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
``:code

and the following action:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage_things():
    return SQLFORM.grid(db.thing)
``:code

This action is special because it returns a widget/helper not a dict of objects. Now we can embed this ``manage_things`` action into any view, with

``
{{=LOAD(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;manage_things&#x27;,ajax=True)}}
``:code

This allows the visitor interact with the component via Ajax without reloading the host page that embeds the widget. Basically the action is called via Ajax, inherits the stile of the host page, and capture all forms submissions and flash messages so that they are handled within the current page. On top of this the ``SQLFORM.grid`` widget uses digitally signed URLs to restrict access. More information about components can be found in chapter 13.

Components like the one above can be embedded into wiki pages using the MARKMIN syntax:

``
@{component:default/manage_things}
``

This simply tells web2py that we want to incude the &quot;manage_things&quot; action defined in the &quot;default&quot; controller as an Ajax &quot;component&quot;.

---------
Most users will be able to build relatively complex applications simply by using ``auth.wiki`` to create pages and menus and embedded custom components into wiki pages. Wikis can be thought of as a mechanism to allow members of the group to create pages, but they can also be thought of as a way to develop applications in a modular way.
---------

### More on **admin**
``admin``:inxx

The administrative interface provides additional functionality that we briefly review here.

#### Site
``site``:inxx

This page is the main administrative interface of web2py. It lists all installed applications on the left, while on the right side there are some special action forms.

The first of them shows the web2py version and proposes to upgrade it if new versions are available. Of course, before upgrading be sure to have a full working backup!
Then there are two other forms that allow the creation of a new application (simple or by using an online wizard) by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The following form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it (using different names
allows you to install multiple copies of the same application). You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or Instant Press CMS created by Martin Mulone:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or one of the many example applications available at:

``
http://web2py.com/appliances
``

------
Web2py files are packages as ``.w2p`` files. These ones are tar gzipped files. Web2py uses the ``.w2p`` extension instead of the ``.tgz`` extension to prevent the browser from unzipping on download. They can be uncompressed manually with ``tar zxvf [filename]`` although this is never necessary.
------

[[image @///image/en4100.png center 444px]]

Upon successful upload, web2py displays the MD5 checksum of the uploaded file. You can use it to verify that the file was not corrupted during upload. The InstantPress name will appear in the list of installed applications.

If you run web2py from source and you have ``gitpython`` installed (if necessary, set it up with &#x27;easy_install gitpython&#x27;), you can install applications directly from git repositories
using the ``.git`` URL in the upload form. In this case you will also be enabled to use the admin interface to push changes back into the repository, but this is an experimental feature.

For example, you can locally install the application that shows this book on the web2py site with the URL:

``
https://github.com/mdipierro/web2py-book.git
``

------
That repository hosts the current, updated version of this book (which could be different from the stable version you can see on the web site). You are warmly invited to use it for submitting
improvements, fixes and corrections in the form of pull requests.
------
  
For each application installed you can use the &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page to:
- Go directly to the application by clicking on its name.
- Uninstall the application.
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Clean up temporary files (sessions, errors, and cache.disk files).
- Pack all. This returns a tar file containing a complete copy of the application. We suggest that you clean up temporary files before packing an application.
- Compile the application. If there are no errors, this option will bytecode-compile all models, controllers and views. Because views can extend and include other views in a tree, before bytecode compilation, the view tree for every controller is collapsed into a single file. The net effect is that a bytecode-compiled application is faster, because there is no more parsing of templates or string substitutions occurring at runtime.
- Pack compiled. This option is only present for bytecode-compiled applications. It allows packing the application without source code for distribution as closed source. Note that Python (as any other programming language) can technically be decompiled; therefore compilation does not provide complete protection of the source code. Nevertheless, decompilation can be difficult and can be illegal.
- Remove compiled. It simply removes the byte-code compiled models, views and controllers from the application. If the application was packaged with source code or edited locally, there is no harm in removing the bytecode-compiled files, and the application will continue to work. If the application was installed form a packed compiled file, then this is not safe, because there is no source code to revert to, and the application will no longer work.

``admin.py``:inxx

-------
All the functionality available from the web2py admin site page is also accessible programmatically via the API defined in the module ``gluon/admin.py``. Simply open a python shell and import this module.
-------

If the Google App Engine SDK is installer the admin &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page shows a button to push your applications to GAE. If ``python-git`` is installed, there is also a button to push your application to Open Shift. To install applications on ``Heroku`` or other hosting system you should look into the &quot;scripts&quot; folder for the appropriate script.

#### About
``about``:inxx ``license``:inxx

The &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; tab allows editing the description of the application and its license. These are written respectively in the ABOUT and LICENSE files in the application folder.

[[image @///image/en4300.png center 480px]]

You can use ``MARKMIN``, or ``gluon.contrib.markdown.WIKI`` syntax for these files as described in ref.``markdown2``:cite .

#### Design
``EDIT``:inxx
You have used the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page already in this chapter. Here we want to point out a few more functionalities of the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page.
- If you click on any file name, you can see the contents of the file with syntax highlighting.
- If you click on edit, you can edit the file via a web interface.
- If you click on delete, you can delete the file (permanently).
- If you click on test, web2py will run tests. Tests are written by the developer using Python doctests, and each function should have its own tests.
- You can add language files, scan the app to discover all strings, and edit string translations via the web interface.
- If the static files are organized in folders and subfolders, the folder hierarchy can be toggled by clicking on a folder name.

The image below shows the output of the test page for the welcome application.
The image below show the languages tab for the welcome application.
[[image @///image/en4500.png center 480px]]

The image below shows how to edit a language file, in this case the &quot;it&quot; (Italian) language for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4600.png center 480px]]

##### Integrated debugger

&#x27;&#x27;(requires Python 2.6 or later)&#x27;&#x27;

The web2py admin includes a web based debugger. Using the provided web-based editor you can add breakpoints to the Python code and, from the associated debugger console, you can inspect the system variables at those breakpoints and resume execution. This is illustrated in the following screenshot:

[[image @///image/debugger.png center 480px]]

This functionality is based on the Qdb debugger created by Mariano Reingart.
It uses multiprocessing.connection to communicate between the backend
and frontend, with a JSON-RPC-like stream protocol. ``qdb``:cite

##### Shell

If you click on the &quot;shell&quot; link under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27;, web2py will open a web based Python shell and will execute the models for the current application. This allows you to interactively talk to your application.

[[image @///image/en4700.png center 480px]]

-------
Be careful using the web based shell - because different shell requests will be executed in different threads. This easily gives errors, especially if you play with databases
creation and connections. For activities like these (i.e. if you need persistence) it&#x27;s much better to use the python command line.
-------
##### Crontab

Also under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; there is a &quot;crontab&quot; link. By clicking on this link you will be able to edit the web2py crontab file. This follows the same syntax as the unix crontab but does not rely on unix. In fact, it only requires web2py, and it works on Windows. It allows you to register actions that need to be executed in background at scheduled times.
For more information about this, see the next chapter.

#### Errors
``errors``:inxx

When programming web2py, you will inevitably make mistakes and introduce bugs. web2py helps in two ways: 1) it allows you to create tests for every function that can be run in the browser from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page; and 2) when an error manifests itself, a ticket is issued to the visitor and the error is logged.

Intentionally introduce an error in the images application as shown below:
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL,orderby=db.image.title)
    1/0
    return dict(images=images)
``:code

When you access the index action, you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en4800.png center 480px]]

Only the administrator can access the ticket:

[[image @///image/en4900.png center 480px]]

The ticket shows the traceback, and the content of the file that caused the problem, and the complete state of system (variables, request, session, etc.) If the error occurs in a view, web2py shows the view converted from HTML into Python code. This allows to easily identify the logical structure of the file.

By default tickets are stored on filesystem and group by traceback. The administrative interface provides an aggregate views (type of traceback and number of occurrence) and a detailed view (all tickets are listed by ticket id). The administrator can switch between the two views.

Notice that everywhere **admin** shows syntax-highlighted code (for example, in error reports, web2py keywords are shown in orange). If you click on a web2py keyword, you are redirected to a documentation page about the keyword.

If you fix the divide-by-zero bug in the index action and introduce one in the index view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}

&lt;h1&gt;Current Images&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{{for image in images:}}
{{1/0}}
{{=LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&quot;show&quot;, args=image.id)))}}
{{pass}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en5000.png center 480px]]

Note that web2py has converted the view from HTML into a Python file, and the error described in the ticket refers to the generated Python code and NOT to the original view file:

[[image @///image/en5100.png center 480px]]

This may seem confusing at first, but in practice it makes debugging easier, because the Python indentation highlights the logical structure of the code that you embedded in the views.

The code is shown at the bottom of the same page.

All tickets are listed under admin in the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page for each application:

You can access the wizard from the &quot;sites&quot; page as shown in the image below.
The wizard will guide you through a series of steps involved in creating a new application:

- Chose a name for the application
- Configure the application and choose required plugins
- Build required models (it will create CRUD pages for each model)
- Allow you to edit the views of those pages using MARKMIN syntax

The image below shows the second step of the process.

[[image @///image/en5500.png center 480px]]

You can see a dropdown to select a layout plugin (from ``web2py.com/layouts``), a multiple choice dropdown to check other plugins (from ``web2py.com/plugins``) and a &quot;login config&quot; field where to put the Janrain &quot;domain:key&quot;.

The other steps are pretty much self-explanatory.

The Wizard works well for what it does but it is considered an &#x27;&#x27;experimental feature&#x27;&#x27; for two reasons:

- Applications created with the wizard and edited manually, cannot later be modified by the wizard.
- The interface of the wizard will change over time to include support for more features and easier visual development.

In any case the wizard is a handy tool for fast prototyping and it can be used to bootstrap a new application with an alternate layout and optional plugins.

#### Configuring **admin**

Normally there is no need to perform any configuration of admin but a few customizations are possible. After you login into admin you can edit the admin configuration file via the URL:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/edit/admin/models/0.py
``
Notice that **admin** can be used to edit itself. In fact **admin** is an app as any other one.

The file &quot;0.py&quot; is very much self documented and if you are opening probably you already know what you are looking for. Anyway few customizations exist that are more important than others:

``
GAE_APPCFG = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(&#x27;/usr/local/bin/appcfg.py&#x27;))
``
This should point to the location of the &quot;appcfg.py&quot; file that comes with the Google App Engine SDK. If you have the SDK you may want to change this config parameters to the correct value. It will allow you to deploy to GAE from the admin interface.

``DEMO_MODE``:inxx

You can also set web2py admin in demo mode:
``
DEMO_MODE = True
FILTER_APPS = [&#x27;welcome&#x27;]
``
And only the apps listed in filter apps will be accessible and they will be only accessible in read-only mode.

``MULTI_USER_MODE``:inxx
``virtual laboratory``:inxx

If you are a teacher and want to expose the administrative interface to students so that students can share one administrative interface for their projects (think of a virtual lab), can do it by setting:
``
MULTI_USER_MODE = True
``
In this way students will be required to login and will only be able to access their own apps via admin. You, as first user/teacher, will be able to access them all.

In multi user mode, you can register students using the &quot;bulk register&quot; link in admin and manage them using the &quot;manage students&quot; link. The system also keep track of when students login and how many lines of code add/remove to/from their code. This data is presented to the administrator as charts under the application &quot;about&quot; page.

Mind that this mechanism still assumes all users are trusted. All the apps created under admin run under the same credentials on the same filesystem. It is possible for an app created by a student to access the data and the source of an app created by another student. It is also possible for a student to create an app that locks the server.

#### Mobile **admin**

Notice that the admin application includes &quot;plugin_jqmodile&quot; which packages jQuery Mobile. When admin is accessed from a mobile device; this is detected by web2py and the interface is displayed using a mobile-friendly layout.

### More on **appadmin**

``appadmin``:inxx

**appadmin** is not intended to be exposed to the public. It is designed to help you by providing an easy access to the database. It consists of only two files: a controller &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and a view &quot;appadmin.html&quot; which are used by all actions in the controller.

The **appadmin** controller is relatively small and readable; it provides an example of designing a database interface.

**appadmin** shows which databases are available and which tables exist in each database. You can insert records and list all records for each table individually. **appadmin** paginates output 100 records at a time.

Once a set of records is selected, the header of the pages changes, allowing you to update or delete the selected records.

To update the records, enter an SQL assignment in the Query string field:
``
title = &#x27;test&#x27;
``:code

where string values must be enclosed in single quotes. Multiple fields can be separated by commas.

To delete a record, click the corresponding checkbox to confirm that you are sure.

**appadmin** can also perform joins if the SQL FILTER contains a SQL condition that involves two or more tables. For example, try:
``
db.image.id == db.post.image_id
``:code

web2py passes this along to the DAL, and it understands that the query links two tables; hence, both tables are selected with an INNER JOIN. Here is the output:

[[image @///image/en5600.png center 480px]]

If you click on the number of an id field, you get an edit page for the record with the corresponding id.

If you click on the number of a reference field, you get an edit page for the referenced record.

You cannot update or delete rows selected by a join, because they involve records from multiple tables and this would be ambiguous.

In addition to its database administration capabilities, **appadmin** also enables you to view details about the contents of the application&#x27;s ``cache`` (at ``/yourapp/appadmin/ccache``) as well as the contents of the current ``request``, ``response``, and ``session`` objects (at ``/yourapp/appadmin/state``).

    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #DFF0D8;">------
Also note that ``auth.wiki(&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)``:code is the same as ``auth.wiki(slug=&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)``:code, since the slug kwarg is the first in the method signature. The former gives a slightly simpler syntax.
------


You can also embed special wiki functions as the search by tags:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_search&#x27;)}}
``:code

or the tag cloud:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_cloud&#x27;)}}
``:code


#### Extending the auth.wiki feature

When your wiki-enabled gets more complicated, perhaps you might need to customize the wiki db records managed by the Auth interface or expose customized forms for wiki CRUD tasks. For example, you might want to customize a wiki table record representation or add a new field validator. This is not allowed by default, since the wiki model is defined only after the wiki interface is requested with the auth.wiki() method. To allow access to the wiki specific db setup within the model of your app you must add the following sentence to your model file (i.e. db.py)

``
# Make sure this is called after the auth instance is created
# and before any change to the wiki tables
auth.wiki(resolve=False)
``:code

By using the line above in your model, the wiki tables will be accessible (i.e. ``wiki_page``) for custom CRUD or other db tasks.

------
Note that you still have to call auth.wiki() in the controller or view in order to expose the wiki interface, since the ``resolve=False`` parameter instructs the auth object to just build the wiki model without any other interface setup.
------


Also, by setting resolve to ``True`` in the method call, the wiki tables will be now accesible trough the app&#x27;s default db interface at ``&lt;app&gt;/appadmin`` for managing wiki records.


Another customization possible is adding extra fields to the standard wiki tables (in the same way as with the ``auth_user`` table, as described in Chapter 9). Here is how:

``
# Place this after auth object initialization
auth.settings.extra_fields[&quot;wiki_page&quot;] = [Field(&quot;ablob&quot;, &quot;blob&quot;),]
``:code

The line above adds a blob field to the wiki_page table. There is no need to call ``auth.wiki(resolve=False)``:code for this option, unless you need access to the wiki model for other customizations.

Attention, to run web2py on Windows from source you must install first Mark Hammond&#x27;s win32 extensions from ``http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/``.
------

The web2py program accepts various command line options which are discussed later.

By default, at startup, web2py displays a startup window and then displays a GUI widget that asks you to choose a one-time administrator password, the IP address of the network interface to be used for the web server, and a port number from which to serve requests. By default, web2py runs its web server on 127.0.0.1:8000 (port 8000 on localhost), but you can run it on any available IP address and port. You can query the IP address of your network interface by opening a command line and typing ``ipconfig`` on Windows or ``ifconfig`` on OS X and Linux. From now on we assume web2py is running on localhost (127.0.0.1:8000). Use 0.0.0.0:80 to run web2py publicly on any of your network interfaces.

[[image @///image/en400.png center 306px]]

If you do not provide an administrator password, the administration interface is disabled. This is a security measure to prevent publicly exposing the admin interface.

The administrative interface, **admin**, is only accessible from localhost unless you run web2py behind Apache with mod_proxy. If **admin** detects a proxy, the session cookie is set to secure and **admin** login does not work unless the communication between the client and the proxy goes over HTTPS; this is a security measure. All communications between the client and **admin** must always be local or encrypted; otherwise an attacker would be able to perform a man-in-the middle attack or a replay attack and execute arbitrary code on the server.

After the administration password has been set, web2py starts up the web browser at the page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
``:code

If the computer does not have a default browser, open a web browser and enter the URL.

[[image @///image/en500.png center 480px]]

Clicking on &quot;administrative interface&quot; takes you to the login page for the administration interface.

[[image @///image/en600.png center 480px]]

The administrator password is the password you chose at startup.
Notice that there is only one administrator, and therefore only one administrator password. For security reasons, the developer is asked to choose a new password every time web2py starts unless the &lt;recycle&gt; option is specified. This is distinct from the authentication mechanism in web2py applications.

After the administrator logs into web2py, the browser is redirected to the &quot;site&quot; page.

[[image @///image/en700.png center 480px]]

This page lists all installed web2py applications and allows the administrator to manage them.
web2py comes with three applications:
``admin``:inxx ``examples``:inxx ``welcome``:inxx ``scaffolding``:inxx
- An **admin** application, the one you are using right now.
- An **examples** application, with the online interactive documentation and a replica of the web2py official website.
- A **welcome** application. This is the basic template for any other web2py application. It is referred to as the &#x27;&#x27;scaffolding application&#x27;&#x27;. This is also the application that welcomes a user at startup.

``appliances``:inxx
Ready-to-use web2py applications are referred to as web2py &#x27;&#x27;appliances&#x27;&#x27;.  You can download many freely available appliances from ``appliances``:cite . web2py users are encouraged to submit new appliances, either in open-source or closed-source (compiled and packed) form.

From the **admin** application&#x27;s &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page, you can perform the following operations:
- **install** an application by completing the form on the bottom right of the page. Give a name to the application, select the file containing a packaged application or the URL where the application is located, and click &quot;submit&quot;.
- **uninstall** an application by clicking the corresponding button. There is a confirmation page.
- **create** a new application by choosing a name and clicking &quot;create&quot;.
- **package** an application for distribution by clicking on the corresponding button. A downloaded application is a tar file containing everything, including the database. You should not untar this file; it is automatically unpackaged by web2py when installed with **admin**.
- **clean up** an application&#x27;s temporary files, such as sessions, errors and cache files.
- **enable/disable** each application. When an application is disabled it cannot be called remotely but it is not disabled form localhost. This means disabled applications can still be accessed behind a proxy. An application is disabled by creating a file called &quot;DISABLED&quot; in the application folder. Users who try to access a disabled application will receive a 503 HTTP error. You can use routes_onerror to customize the error page.
- **EDIT** an application.

-----
When you create a new application using **admin**, it starts as a clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; scaffolding app with a &quot;models/db.py&quot; that creates a SQLite database, connects to it, instantiates Auth, Crud, and Service, and configures them. It also provides a &quot;controller/default.py&quot; which exposes actions &quot;index&quot;, &quot;download&quot;, &quot;user&quot; for user management, and &quot;call&quot; for services. In the following, we assume that these files have been removed; we will be creating apps from scratch.
-----

web2py also comes with a **wizard**, described later in this chapter, that can write an alternate scaffolding code for you based on layouts and plugins available on the web and based on high level description of the models.

### Simple examples

#### Say hello
``index``:inxx

Here, as an example, we create a simple web app that displays the message &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot; to the user. We will call this application &quot;myapp&quot;. We will also add a counter that counts how many times the same user visits the page.

You can create a new application simply by typing its name in the form on the top right of the **site** page in **admin**.

[[image @///image/en800.png center 447px]]

After you press [create], the application is created as a copy of the built-in welcome application.

[[image @///image/en900.png center 480px]]

To run the new application, visit:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp
``:code

Now you have a copy of the welcome application.

Here is what the online editor looks like:

Save it and go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. Click on the index link to visit the newly created page.

When you visit the URL
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/default/index
``:code

the index action in the default controller of the myapp application is called. It returns a string that the browser displays for us. It should look like this:

[[image @///image/en1100.png center 480px]]

Now, edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def index():
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;)
``:code

Also from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page, edit the view &quot;default/index.html&quot; (the view file associated with the action) and completely replace the existing contents of that file with the following:
``
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{=message}}&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
``:code

Now the action returns a dictionary defining a ``message``. When an action returns a dictionary, web2py looks for a view with the name

``
[controller]/[function].[extension]
``:code

and executes it. Here ``[extension]`` is the requested extension. If no extension is specified, it defaults to &quot;html&quot;, and that is what we will assume here. Under this assumption, the view is an HTML file that embeds Python code using special {{ }} tags. In particular, in the example, the ``{{=message}}`` instructs web2py to replace the tagged code with the value of the ``message`` returned by the action. Notice that ``message`` here is not a web2py keyword but is defined in the action. So far we have not used any web2py keywords.

If web2py does not find the requested view, it uses the &quot;generic.html&quot; view that comes with every application.

-------
``Mac Mail``:inxx ``Google Maps``:inxx ``jsonp``:inxx
If an extension other than &quot;html&quot; is specified (&quot;json&quot; for example), and the view file &quot;[controller]/[function].json&quot; is not found, web2py looks for the view &quot;generic.json&quot;. web2py comes with generic.html, generic.json, generic.jsonp, generic.xml, generic.rss, generic.ics (for Mac Mail Calendar), generic.map (for embedding Google Maps), and generic.pdf (based on fpdf). These generic views can be modified for each application individually, and additional views can be added easily.
-------

-------
Generic views are a development tool. In production every action should have its own view. In fact, by default, generic views are only enabled from localhost.
-------

-------
You can also specify a view with ``response.view = &#x27;default/something.html&#x27;``
-------

Read more on this topic in Chapter 10.

If you go back to &quot;EDIT&quot; and click on index, you will now see the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1200.png center 480px]]

#### Debugging toolbar
``toolbar``:inxx

For debugging purposes you can insert

``
{{=response.toolbar()}}
``:code

to the code in a view and it will show you some useful information, including the request, response and session objects, and list all db queries with their timing.

#### Let&#x27;s count
``session``:inxx
Let&#x27;s now add a counter to this page that will count how many times the same visitor displays the page.

web2py automatically and transparently tracks visitors using sessions and cookies. For each new visitor, it creates a session and assigns a unique &quot;session_id&quot;. The session is a container for variables that are stored server-side. The unique id is sent to the browser via a cookie. When the visitor requests another page from the same application, the browser sends the cookie back, it is retrieved by web2py, and the corresponding session is restored.

To use the session, modify the default controller:
``
def index():
    if not session.counter:
        session.counter = 1
    else:
        session.counter += 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
``:code

Notice that ``counter`` is not a web2py keyword but ``session`` is. We are asking web2py to check whether there is a counter variable in the session and, if not, to create one and set it to 1. If the counter is there, we ask web2py to increase the counter by 1. Finally we pass the value of the counter to the view.

A more compact way to code the same function is this:
``
def index():
    session.counter = (session.counter or 0) + 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
A better pattern for form submission is to submit forms to the same action that
Modify the default controller to implement self-submission:
``
def first():
    if request.vars.visitor_name:
        session.visitor_name = request.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then modify the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
What is your name?
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

and the &quot;default/second.html&quot; view needs to retrieve the data from the ``session`` instead of from the ``request.vars``:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=session.visitor_name or &quot;anonymous&quot;}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

From the point of view of the visitor, the self-submission behaves exactly the same as the previous implementation. We have not added validation yet, but it is now clear that validation should be performed by the first action.

This approach is better also because the name of the visitor stays in the session, and can be accessed by all actions and views in the application without having to be passed around explicitly.

Note that if the &quot;second&quot; action is ever called before a visitor name is set, it will display &quot;Hello anonymous&quot; because  ``session.visitor_name`` returns ``None``. Alternatively we could have added the following code in the controller (inside the ``second`` function):

``
if not request.function==&#x27;first&#x27; and not session.visitor_name:
    redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
``:code

This is an &#x27;&#x27;ad hoc&#x27;&#x27;  mechanism that you can use to enforce authorization on controllers, though see Chapter 9 for a more powerful method.

``FORM``:inxx ``INPUT``:inxx ``requires``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx

With web2py we can move one step further and ask web2py to generate the form for us, including validation. web2py provides helpers (FORM, INPUT, TEXTAREA, and SELECT/OPTION) with the same names as the equivalent HTML tags. They can be used to build forms either in the controller or in the view.

For example, here is one possible way to rewrite the first action:
``
def first():
    form = FORM(INPUT(_name=&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
              INPUT(_type=&#x27;submit&#x27;))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

where we are saying that the FORM tag contains two INPUT tags. The attributes of the input tags are specified by the named arguments starting with underscore. The ``requires`` argument is not a tag attribute (because it does not start by underscore) but it sets a validator for the value of visitor_name.

Here is yet another better way to create the same form:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;,
                                 label=&#x27;what is your name?&#x27;,
                                 requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

The ``form`` object can be easily serialized in HTML by embedding it in the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view.
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=form}}
``:code

The ``form.process()`` method applies the validators and returns the form itself. The ``form.accepted`` variable is set to True if the form was processed and passed validation. If the self-submitted form passes validation, it stores the variables in the session and redirects as before. If the form does not pass validation, error messages are inserted into the form and shown to the user, as below:

[[image @///image/en1800.png center 480px]]

In the next section we will show how forms can be generated automatically from a model.

In all our examples we have used the session to pass the user name from the first action to the second. We could have used a different mechanism and passed data as part of a redirect URL:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;,vars=dict(name=name)))
    return dict(form=form)

def second():
    name = request.vars.visitor_name or redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
    return dict(name=name)
``:code

Mind that in general it is not a good idea to pass data from one action to another using the URL. It makes it harder to secure the application. It is safer to store the data in a session.

#### Internationalization

Your code is likely to include hardcoded strings such as &quot;What is your name?&quot;. You should be able to customize strings without editing the code and in particular insert translations for these strings in different languages. In this way if a visitor has the language preference of the browser set to &quot;Italian&quot;, web2py will use the Italian translation for the strings, if available. This feature of web2py is called &quot;internationalization&quot; and it is described in more detail in the next chapter.

Here we just observe that in order to use this feature you should markup strings that needs translation. This is done by wrapping a quoted string in code such as

``
&quot;What is your name?&quot;
``:code

with the ``T`` operator:

``
T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)
``:code


You can also mark for translations strings hardcoded in views. For example

``
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

becomes

``
&lt;h1&gt;{{=T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

It is good practice to do this for every string in the code (field labels, flash messages, etc.) except for tables and field names.

Once the strings are identified and marked up, web2py takes care of almost everything else. The admin interface also provides a page where you can translate each string in the languages you desire to support.

-----------
web2py includes a powerful pluralization engine which is described in the next chapter. It is integrated with both the internationalization engine and the markmin renderer.

### An image blog
``upload``:inxx

Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments (posts).

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;post&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;email&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;))

db.image.title.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)
db.post.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
db.post.author.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()
db.post.email.requires = IS_EMAIL()
db.post.body.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()

db.post.image_id.writable = db.post.image_id.readable = False
``:code

Let&#x27;s analyze this line by line.

Line 1 defines a global variable called ``db`` that represents the database connection. In this case it is a connection to a SQLite database stored in the file  &quot;applications/images/databases/storage.sqlite&quot;. When using SQLite, if the database file does not exist, it is created. You can change the name of the file, as well as the name of the global variable ``db``, but it is convenient to give them the same name, to make it easy to remember.

Lines 3-6 define a table &quot;image&quot;. ``define_table`` is a method of the ``db`` object. The first argument, &quot;image&quot;, is the name of the table we are defining. The other arguments are the fields belonging to that table. This table has a field called &quot;title&quot;, a field called &quot;file&quot;, and a field called &quot;id&quot; that serves as the table primary key (&quot;id&quot; is not explicitly declared because all tables have an id field by default). The field &quot;title&quot; is a string, and the field &quot;file&quot; is of type &quot;upload&quot;. &quot;upload&quot; is a special type of field used by the web2py Data Abstraction Layer (DAL) to store the names of uploaded files. web2py knows how to upload files (via streaming if they are large), rename them safely, and store them.

When a table is defined, web2py takes one of several possible actions:
- if the table does not exist, the table is created;
- if the table exists and does not correspond to the definition, the table is altered accordingly, and if a field has a different type, web2py tries to convert its contents;
- if the table exists and corresponds to the definition, web2py does nothing.

This behavior is called &quot;migration&quot;. In web2py migrations are automatic, but can be disabled for each table by passing ``migrate=False`` as the last argument of ``define_table``.

Line 6 defines a format string for the table. It determines how a record should be represented as a string. Notice that the ``format`` argument can also be a function that takes a record and returns a string. For example:

``
format=lambda row: row.title
``:code

Lines 8-12 define another table called &quot;post&quot;.
A post has an &quot;author&quot;, an &quot;email&quot; (we intend to store the email address of the author of the post), a &quot;body&quot; of type &quot;text&quot; (we intend to use it to store the actual comment posted by the author), and an &quot;image_id&quot; field of type reference that points to ``db.image`` via the &quot;id&quot; field.

In line 14, ``db.image.title`` represents the field &quot;title&quot; of table &quot;image&quot;. The attribute ``requires`` allows you to set requirements/constraints that will be enforced by web2py forms. Here we require that the &quot;title&quot; is unique:

``IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)``:code

&#x27;&#x27;Notice this is optional because it is set automatically given that ``Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True)``&#x27;&#x27;.

The objects representing these constraints are called validators. Multiple validators can be grouped in a list. Validators are executed in the order they appear.
``IS_NOT_IN_DB(a, b)`` is a special validator that checks that the value of a field ``b`` for a new record is not already in ``a``.

Line 15 requires that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;post&quot; is in ``db.image.id``. As far as the database is concerned, we had already declared this  when we defined the table &quot;post&quot;.
Now we are explicitly telling the model that this condition should be enforced by web2py, too, at the form processing level when a new comment is posted, so that invalid values do not propagate from input forms to the database. We also require that the &quot;image_id&quot; be represented by the &quot;title&quot;, ``&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;``, of the corresponding record.

Line 20 indicates that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;post&quot; should not be shown in forms, ``writable=False`` and not even in read-only forms, ``readable=False``.

The meaning of the validators in lines 17-18 should be obvious.

``format``:inxx
Notice that the validator
``
db.post.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

can be omitted (and would be automatic) if we specify a format for referenced table:
``
db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;, ..., format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

where the format can be a string or a function that takes a record and returns a string.

``appadmin``:inxx
Once a model is defined, if there are no errors, web2py creates an application administration interface to manage the database. You access it via the &quot;database administration&quot; link in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page or directly:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/appadmin
``:code

Here is a screenshot of the **appadmin** interface:

[[image @///image/en2100.png center 480px]]

This interface is coded in the controller called &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and the corresponding view &quot;appadmin.html&quot;. From now on, we will refer to this interface simply as **appadmin**. It allows the administrator to insert new database records, edit and delete existing records, browse tables, and perform database joins.

The first time **appadmin** is accessed, the model is executed and the tables are created. The web2py DAL translates Python code into SQL statements that are specific to the selected database back-end (SQLite in this example). You can see the generated SQL from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page by clicking on the &quot;sql.log&quot; link under &quot;models&quot;. Notice that the link is not present until the tables have been created.

``:code


Lines 2-6 constitute a comment for the index action. Lines 4-5 inside the comment are interpreted by python as test code (doctest). Tests can be run via the admin interface. In this case the tests verify that the index action runs without errors.

Lines 18, 27, and 35 try to fetch a ``page`` record with the id in
``request.args(0)``.

Lines 13, 20 define and process create forms for a new page and a new comment and

Line 28 defines and processes an update form for a wiki page.

Line 38 creates a ``grid`` object that allows to view, add and update the comments linked to a page.

Some magic happens in line 51. The ``onkeyup`` attribute of the INPUT tag &quot;keyword&quot; is set. Every time the visitor releases a key, the JavaScript code inside the ``onkeyup`` attribute is executed, client-side. Here is the JavaScript code:
``
ajax(&#x27;callback&#x27;, [&#x27;keyword&#x27;], &#x27;target&#x27;);
``:code
``ajax`` is a JavaScript function defined in the file &quot;web2py.js&quot; which is included by the default &quot;layout.html&quot;. It takes three parameters: the URL of the action that performs the synchronous callback, a list of the IDs of variables to be sent to the callback ([&quot;keyword&quot;]), and the ID where the response has to be inserted (&quot;target&quot;).

As soon as you type something in the search box and release a key, the client calls the server and sends the content of the &#x27;keyword&#x27; field, and, when the sever responds, the response is embedded in the page itself as the innerHTML of the &#x27;target&#x27; tag.

The &#x27;target&#x27; tag is a DIV defined in line 52. It could have been defined in the view as well.

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/create.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Create new wiki page&lt;/h1&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

Assuming you are registered and logged in, if you visit the **create** page, you see the following:

[[image @///image/en3500.png center 480px]]
Here is the code for the view &quot;default/index.html&quot;:
     {{=LI(A(page.title, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=page.id)))}}
{{pass}}&lt;/ul&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;create page&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;create&#x27;))}} ]
``:code

It generates the following page:

[[image @///image/en3600.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;:

``markdown``:inxx ``MARKMIN``:inxx
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;{{=page.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;edit&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;edit&#x27;, args=request.args))}}
| {{=A(&#x27;documents&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;documents&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
{{for post in comments:}}
  &lt;p&gt;{{=db.auth_user[post.created_by].first_name}} on {{=post.created_on}}
     says &lt;i&gt;{{=post.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

If you wish to use markdown syntax instead of markmin syntax:

``
from gluon.contrib.markdown import WIKI as MARKDOWN
``:code

and use ``MARKDOWN`` instead of the ``MARKMIN`` helper.
Alternatively, you can choose to accept raw HTML instead of markmin syntax. In this case you would replace:
``
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
``:code

with:
``
{{=XML(page.body)}}
``:code

``sanitize``:inxx
(so that the XML does not get escaped, which web2py normally does by default for security reasons).

This can be done better with:
``
{{=XML(page.body, sanitize=True)}}
``:code

By setting ``sanitize=True``, you tell web2py to escape unsafe XML tags such as &quot;&lt;script&gt;&quot;, and thus prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Now if, from the index page, you click on a page title, you can see the page that you have created:

[[image @///image/en3700.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/edit.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}

[ {{=A(&#x27;show&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=form}}
If you look at the page source you see the HTML returned by the callback:
Generating an RSS feed of your wiki pages using web2py is easy because web2py includes ``gluon.contrib.rss2``. Just append the following action to the default controller:
``
def news():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;generates rss feed form the wiki pages&quot;&quot;&quot;
    response.generic_patterns = [&#x27;.rss&#x27;]

       description = &#x27;mywiki news&#x27;,
       created_on = request.now,
       items = [
          dict(title = row.title,
               link = URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=row.id),
               description = MARKMIN(row.body).xml(),
               created_on = row.created_on
               ) for row in pages])
``:code

and when you visit the page
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/news.rss
``:code

you see the feed (the exact output depends on the feed reader). Notice that the dict is automatically converted to RSS, thanks to the .rss extension in the URL.

[[image @///image/en4000.png center 480px]]

web2py also includes feedparser to read third-party feeds.

Notice that the line:

``
response.generic_patterns = [&#x27;.rss&#x27;]
``:code

instructs web2py to use generic views (in our case &quot;views/generic.rss&quot;) when the URL ends in the glob pattern &quot;.rss&quot;. By default generic views are only allowed from localhost for development purposes.

``XMLRPC``:inxx
Finally, let&#x27;s add an XML-RPC handler that allows searching the wiki programmatically:
``
service = Service()

@service.xmlrpc
def find_by(keyword):
     &quot;&quot;&quot;finds pages that contain keyword for XML-RPC&quot;&quot;&quot;
     return db(db.page.title.contains(keyword)).select().as_list()

def call():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;exposes all registered services, including XML-RPC&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return service()
``:code

Here, the handler action simply publishes (via XML-RPC), the functions specified in the list. In this case, ``find_by``. ``find_by`` is not an action (because it takes an argument). It queries the database with ``.select()`` and then extracts the records as a list with ``.response`` and returns the list.

Here is an example of how to access the XML-RPC handler from an external
Python program.
``
&gt;&gt;&gt; import xmlrpclib
&gt;&gt;&gt; server = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(
    &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/call/xmlrpc&#x27;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in server.find_by(&#x27;wiki&#x27;):
        print item[&#x27;created_on&#x27;], item[&#x27;title&#x27;]
``:code

The handler can be accessed from many other programming languages that understand XML-RPC, including C, C++, C# and Java.

#### On ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time`` format
yet this representation is internationalized and you can use the admin translati
Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications are written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need to declare that the application&#x27;s current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide an example of the built-in web2py wiki.

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

------
Notice the API of the built-in wiki is still considered experimental and small changes are still possible.
------

Here we assume we are starting from scratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged-in as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is understood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You can make your own view for this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. You do not have to use the &quot;index&quot; action to expose the wiki. You can use an action with a different name.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you to create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have URLs like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_create
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_search
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_could
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_recent
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_edit/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_editmedia/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_preview/...
``

Try to create more pages such as &quot;index&quot;, &quot;aboutus&quot;, and &quot;contactus&quot;.
Try to edit them.


The ``wiki`` method has the following signature:

``
def wiki(self, slug=None, env=None, render=&#x27;markmin&#x27;,
         manage_permissions=False, force_prefix=&#x27;&#x27;,
         restrict_search=False, resolve=True,
         extra=None, menugroups=None)
``:code

It takes the following arguments:

- ``render`` which defaults to ``&#x27;markmin&#x27;`` but can be set equal to ``&#x27;html&#x27;``. It determines the syntax of the wiki. We will discuss the markmin wiki markup later. If you change it to HTML you can use a wysiwyg javascript editor such as TinyMCE or NicEdit.
- ``manage_permissions``. This is set to ``False`` by default and only recognizes permissions for &quot;wiki-editor&quot; and &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you change it to ``True`` the create/edit page will give the option to specify by name the group(s) whose members have permission to read and edit the page. There is a group &quot;everybody&quot; which includes all users.

- ``force_prefix``. If set to something like ``&#x27;%(id)s-&#x27;`` it will restrict authors (not editors) to creating pages with a prefix like &quot;[user id]-[page name]&quot;. The prefix can contain the id (&quot;%(id)s&quot;) or the username (&quot;%(username)s&quot;) or any other field from the auth_user table, as long as the corresponding column contains a valid string that would pass URL validation.
- ``restrict_search``. This defaults to ``False`` and any logged-in user can search all wiki pages (but not necessary read or edit them). If set to ``True``, authors can search only their own pages, editors can search everything, other users cannot search anything.
- ``menu_groups``. This defaults to ``None`` and it indicates that wiki management menu (search, create, edit, etc.) is always displayed. You can set it to a list of group names whose members only can see this menu, for example ``[&#x27;wiki-editor&#x27;,&#x27;wiki-author&#x27;]``. Notice that even if the menu is exposed to everybody that does not mean everybody is allowed to perform actions listed in the menu since they are regulated by the access control system.

The ``wiki`` method has some additional parameters which will be explained later: ``slug``, ``env``, and ``extra``.



#### MARKMIN basics

The MARKMIN syntax allows you to markup **bold** text using ``**bold**``, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27; text with ``&#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;``, and ``code`` text should be delimited by double inverted quotes. Titles must be prefixed by a #, sections by ##, and sub-sections by ###. Use a minus(-) to prefix an un-ordered item and plus(+) to prefix an ordered item. URLs are automatically converted into links. Here is an example of markmin text:

``
# This is a title
## this is a section title
### this is a subsection title

Text can be **bold**, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;, !`!!`!code!`!!`! etc.
Learn more at:

http://web2py.com
``:code


You can use the ``extra`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to pass extra rendering rules to the MARKMIN helper.

You can find more information about the MARKMIN syntax in chapter 5.

``auth.wiki`` is more powerful than the barebones MARKMIN helpers, supporting oembed and components.

You can use the ``env`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to expose functions to your wiki.
For example:

``
auth.wiki(env=dict(join=lambda a,b,c:&quot;%s-%s-%s&quot; % (a,b,c)))
``

allows you to use the markup syntax:

``
@(join:1,2,3)
Supported by oembed:

``
flickr.com
youtube.com
hulu.com
vimeo.com
slideshare.net
qik.com
polleverywhere.com
wordpress.com
revision3.com
viddler.com
``:code

This is implemented in the web2py file ``gluon.contrib.autolinks`` and specifically in the function ``expand_one``. You can extend oembed support by registering more services. This is done by appending an entry to the ``EMBED_MAPS`` list:

``
from gluon.contrib.autolinks import EMBED_MAPS
EMBED_MAPS.append((re.compile(&#x27;http://vimeo.com/\S*&#x27;),
                   &#x27;http://vimeo.com/api/oembed.json&#x27;))
``:code

#### Referencing wiki content

If you create a wiki page with slug &quot;contactus&quot; you can refer to this page as

``
\@////contactus
``:code

Here @````//// stands for

``
\@/app/controller/function/
``:code

but &quot;app&quot;, &quot;controller&quot;, and &quot;function&quot; are omitted thus assuming default.

Similarly you can use the wiki menu to upload a media file (for example an image) linked to the page. The &quot;manage media&quot; page will show all files you have uploaded and will show the proper expression to link the media file. If, for example you upload a file &quot;test.jpg&quot; with title &quot;beach&quot;, the link expression will something like:

``
\@////15/beach.jpg
``:code

``\@////`` is the same prefix described before. ``15`` is the id of the record storing the media file. ``beach`` is the title. ``.jpg`` is the extension of the original file.

If you cut and paste ``\@////15/beach.jpg`` into wiki pages you embed the image.

Mind that media files are linked to pages and inherit access permission from the pages.

#### Wiki menus

If you create a page with slug &quot;wiki-menu&quot; page it will be interpreted as a description of the menu. Here is an example:

``
- Home &gt; \@////index
- Info &gt; \@////info
- web2py &gt; http://google.com
- - About us &gt; \@////aboutus
- - Contact us &gt; \@////contactus
``
Another customization possible is adding extra fields to the standard wiki table
auth.settings.extra_fields[&quot;wiki_page&quot;] = [Field(&quot;ablob&quot;, &quot;blob&quot;),]
``:code

The line above adds a ``blob`` field to the ``wiki_page`` table. There is no need to call ``auth.wiki(resolve=False)``:code for this option, unless you need access to the wiki model for other customizations.


#### Components

One of the most powerful functions of the new web2py consists in the ability of embedding an action inside another action. We call this a component.

Consider the following model:

``
db.define_table(&#x27;thing&#x27;,Field(&#x27;name&#x27;,requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
``:code

and the following action:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage_things():
    return SQLFORM.grid(db.thing)
``:code

This action is special because it returns a widget/helper not a dict of objects. Now we can embed this ``manage_things`` action into any view, with

``
{{=LOAD(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;manage_things&#x27;,ajax=True)}}
``:code

This allows the visitor interact with the component via Ajax without reloading the host page that embeds the widget. The action is called via Ajax, inherits the style of the host page, and captures all form submissions and flash messages so that they are handled within the current page. On top of this the ``SQLFORM.grid`` widget uses digitally signed URLs to restrict access. More information about components can be found in chapter 13.

Components like the one above can be embedded into wiki pages using the MARKMIN syntax:

``
@{component:default/manage_things}
``

This simply tells web2py that we want to include the &quot;manage_things&quot; action defined in the &quot;default&quot; controller as an Ajax &quot;component&quot;.

---------
Most users will be able to build relatively complex applications simply by using ``auth.wiki`` to create pages and menus and embedded custom components into wiki pages. Wikis can be thought of as a mechanism to allow members of the group to create pages, but they can also be thought of as a way to develop applications in a modular way.
---------

### More on **admin**
``admin``:inxx

The administrative interface provides additional functionality that we briefly review here.

#### Site
``site``:inxx

This page is the main administrative interface of web2py. It lists all installed applications on the left, while on the right side there are some special action forms.

The first of them shows the web2py version and proposes to upgrade it if new versions are available. Of course, before upgrading be sure to have a full working backup!
Then there are two other forms that allow the creation of a new application (simple or by using an online wizard) by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The following form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it (using different names
allows you to install multiple copies of the same application). You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

http://mercurial.selenic.com/

The **admin** interface includes a Wizard that can help you create a new applications.
You can access the wizard from the &quot;sites&quot; page as shown in the image below.

[[image @///image/en5400.png center 480px]]

The wizard will guide you through a series of steps involved in creating a new application:

- Chose a name for the application
- Configure the application and choose required plugins
- Build required models (it will create CRUD pages for each model)
- Allow you to edit the views of those pages using MARKMIN syntax

The image below shows the second step of the process.

[[image @///image/en5500.png center 480px]]

You can see a dropdown to select a layout plugin (from ``web2py.com/layouts``), a multiple choice dropdown to check other plugins (from ``web2py.com/plugins``) and a &quot;login config&quot; field where to put the Janrain &quot;domain:key&quot;.

The other steps are pretty much self-explanatory.

The Wizard works well for what it does but it is considered an &#x27;&#x27;experimental feature&#x27;&#x27; for two reasons:

- Applications created with the wizard and edited manually, cannot later be modified by the wizard.
- The interface of the wizard will change over time to include support for more features and easier visual development.

In any case the wizard is a handy tool for fast prototyping and it can be used to bootstrap a new application with an alternate layout and optional plugins.

#### Configuring **admin**

Normally there is no need to perform any configuration of **admin** but a few customizations are possible. After you login into admin you can edit the admin configuration file via the URL:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/edit/admin/models/0.py
``
Notice that **admin** can be used to edit itself. In fact **admin** is an app as any other one.

The file &quot;0.py&quot; is more or less self documented, anyway, here are some of the most important possible customizations:

``
GAE_APPCFG = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(&#x27;/usr/local/bin/appcfg.py&#x27;))
``
This should point to the location of the &quot;appcfg.py&quot; file that comes with the Google App Engine SDK. If you have the SDK you may want to change these config parameters to the correct value. It will allow you to deploy to GAE from the admin interface.

``DEMO_MODE``:inxx

You can also set web2py admin in demo mode:
``
DEMO_MODE = True
FILTER_APPS = [&#x27;welcome&#x27;]
``
And only the apps listed in FILTER_APPS will be accessible and they will be only accessible in read-only mode.

``MULTI_USER_MODE``:inxx
``virtual laboratory``:inxx

If you are a teacher and want to expose the administrative interface to students so that students can share one administrative interface for their projects (think of a virtual lab), can do it by setting:
``
MULTI_USER_MODE = True
``
In this way students will be required to login and will only be able to access their own apps via admin. You, as first user/teacher, will be able to access them all.

In multi user mode, you can register students using the &quot;bulk register&quot; link in admin and manage them using the &quot;manage students&quot; link. The system also keeps track of when students login and how many lines of code they add/remove to/from their code. This data is presented to the administrator as charts under the application &quot;about&quot; page.

Mind that this mechanism still assumes all users are trusted. All the apps created under admin run under the same credentials on the same filesystem. It is possible for an app created by a student to access the data and the source of an app created by another student. It is also possible for a student to create an app that locks the server.

#### Mobile **admin**

Notice that the admin application includes &quot;plugin_jqmobile&quot; which packages jQuery Mobile. When admin is accessed from a mobile device; this is detected by web2py and the interface is displayed using a mobile-friendly layout:

[[image @///image/mobile.png center 306px]]
</pre></div>
    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #F2DEDE;">------
Attention, to run web2py on Windows from source you must install first Mark Hammond&#x27;s [[Python for Windows extensions http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/]]
------

The web2py program accepts various command line options which are discussed later.

By default, at startup, web2py displays a startup window and then displays a GUI widget that asks you to choose a one-time administrator password, the IP address of the network interface to be used for the web server, and a port number from which to serve requests. By default, web2py runs its web server on 127.0.0.1:8000 (port 8000 on localhost), but you can run it on any available IP address and port. You can query the IP address of your network interface by opening a command line and typing ``ipconfig`` on Windows or ``ifconfig`` on OS X and Linux. From now on we assume web2py is running on localhost (127.0.0.1:8000). Use 0.0.0.0:80 to run web2py publicly on any of your network interfaces.

[[image @///image/en400.png center 306px]]

If you do not provide an administrator password, the administration interface is disabled. This is a security measure to prevent publicly exposing the admin interface.

The administrative interface, **admin**, is only accessible from localhost unless you run web2py behind Apache with mod_proxy. If **admin** detects a proxy, the session cookie is set to secure and **admin** login does not work unless the communication between the client and the proxy goes over HTTPS; this is a security measure. All communications between the client and **admin** must always be local or encrypted; otherwise an attacker would be able to perform a man-in-the middle attack or a replay attack and execute arbitrary code on the server.

After the administration password has been set, web2py starts up the web browser at the page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
``:code

If the computer does not have a default browser, open a web browser and enter the URL.

[[image @///image/en500.png center 480px]]

Clicking on &quot;administrative interface&quot; takes you to the login page for the administration interface.

[[image @///image/en600.png center 480px]]

The administrator password is the password you chose at startup.
Notice that there is only one administrator, and therefore only one administrator password. For security reasons, the developer is asked to choose a new password every time web2py starts unless the &lt;recycle&gt; option is specified. This is distinct from the authentication mechanism in web2py applications.

After the administrator logs into web2py, the browser is redirected to the &quot;site&quot; page.

[[image @///image/en700.png center 480px]]

This page lists all installed web2py applications and allows the administrator to manage them.
web2py comes with three applications:
``admin``:inxx ``examples``:inxx ``welcome``:inxx ``scaffolding``:inxx
- An **admin** application, the one you are using right now.
- An **examples** application, with the online interactive documentation and a replica of the web2py official website.
- A **welcome** application. This is the basic template for any other web2py application. It is referred to as the scaffolding application. This is also the application that welcomes a user at startup.

``appliances``:inxx
Ready-to-use web2py applications are referred to as web2py &#x27;&#x27;appliances&#x27;&#x27;.  You can download many freely available appliances from ``appliances``:cite . web2py users are encouraged to submit new appliances, either in open-source or closed-source (compiled and packed) form.

From the **admin** application&#x27;s &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page, you can perform the following operations:
- **install** an application by completing the form on the bottom right of the page. Give a name to the application, select the file containing a packaged application or the URL where the application is located, and click &quot;submit&quot;.
- **uninstall** an application by clicking the corresponding button. There is a confirmation page.
- **create** a new application by choosing a name and clicking &quot;create&quot;.
- **package** an application for distribution by clicking on the corresponding button. A downloaded application is a tar file containing everything, including the database. You should not untar this file; it is automatically unpackaged by web2py when installed with **admin**.
- **clean up** an application&#x27;s temporary files, such as sessions, errors and cache files.
- **EDIT** an application.

-----
When you create a new application using **admin**, it starts as a clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; scaffolding app with a &quot;models/db.py&quot; that creates a SQLite database, connects to it, instantiates Auth, Crud, and Service, and configures them. It also provides a &quot;controller/default.py&quot; which exposes actions &quot;index&quot;, &quot;download&quot;, &quot;user&quot; for user management, and &quot;call&quot; for services. In the following, we assume that these files have been removed; we will be creating apps from scratch.
-----

web2py also comes with a **wizard**, described later in this chapter, that can write an alternate scaffolding code for you based on layouts and plugins available on the web and based on high level description of the models.

### Simple examples

#### Say hello
``index``:inxx

Here, as an example, we create a simple web app that displays the message &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot; to the user. We will call this application &quot;myapp&quot;. We will also add a counter that counts how many times the same user visits the page.

You can create a new application simply by typing its name in the form on the top right of the **site** page in **admin**.

[[image @///image/en800.png center 447px]]

After you press [create], the application is created as a copy of the built-in welcome application.

[[image @///image/en900.png center 480px]]

To run the new application, visit:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp
``:code

Now you have a copy of the welcome application.

Here is what the online editor looks like:

Save it and go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. Click on the index link to visit the newly created page.

When you visit the URL
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/default/index
``:code

the index action in the default controller of the myapp application is called. It returns a string that the browser displays for us. It should look like this:

[[image @///image/en1100.png center 480px]]

Now, edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def index():
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;)
``:code

Also from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page, edit the view &quot;default/index.html&quot; (the view file associated with the action) and completely replace the existing contents of that file with the following:
``
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{=message}}&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
``:code

Now the action returns a dictionary defining a ``message``. When an action returns a dictionary, web2py looks for a view with the name

``[controller]/[function].[extension]``:code

 and executes it. Here [extension] is the requested extension. If no extension is specified, it defaults to &quot;html&quot;, and that is what we will assume here. Under this assumption, the view is an HTML file that embeds Python code using special {{ }} tags. In particular, in the example, the ``{{=message}}`` instructs web2py to replace the tagged code with the value of the ``message`` returned by the action. Notice that ``message`` here is not a web2py keyword but is defined in the action. So far we have not used any web2py keywords.

If web2py does not find the requested view, it uses the &quot;generic.html&quot; view that comes with every application.

-------
``Mac Mail``:inxx ``Google Maps``:inxx ``jsonp``:inxx
If an extension other than &quot;html&quot; is specified (&quot;json&quot; for example), and the view file &quot;[controller]/[function].json&quot; is not found, web2py looks for the view &quot;generic.json&quot;. web2py comes with generic.html, generic.json, generic.jsonp, generic.xml, generic.rss, generic.ics (for Mac Mail Calendar), generic.map (for embedding Google Maps), and generic.pdf (based on fpdf). These generic views can be modified for each application individually, and additional views can be added easily.
-------

-------
Generic views are a development tool. In production every action should have its own view. In fact, by default, generic views are only enabled from localhost.
-------

-------
You can also specify a view with ``response.view = &#x27;default/something.html&#x27;``
-------

Read more on this topic in Chapter 10.

If you go back to &quot;EDIT&quot; and click on index, you will now see the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1200.png center 480px]]

For debugging purposes you can always append

``
{{=response.toolbar()}}
``:code

to the code in a view and it will show you some useful information, including the request, response and session objects, and list all db queries with their timing.

#### Let&#x27;s count
``session``:inxx
Let&#x27;s now add a counter to this page that will count how many times the same visitor displays the page.

web2py automatically and transparently tracks visitors using sessions and cookies. For each new visitor, it creates a session and assigns a unique &quot;session_id&quot;. The session is a container for variables that are stored server-side. The unique id is sent to the browser via a cookie. When the visitor requests another page from the same application, the browser sends the cookie back, it is retrieved by web2py, and the corresponding session is restored.

To use the session, modify the default controller:
``
def index():
    if not session.counter:
        session.counter = 1
    else:
        session.counter += 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
``:code

Notice that ``counter`` is not a web2py keyword but ``session`` is. We are asking web2py to check whether there is a counter variable in the session and, if not, to create one and set it to 1. If the counter is there, we ask web2py to increase the counter by 1. Finally we pass the value of the counter to the view.

A more compact way to code the same function is this:
``
def index():
    session.counter = (session.counter or 0) + 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
A better pattern for form submission is to submit forms to the same action that
Modify the default controller to implement self-submission:
``
def first():
    if request.vars.visitor_name:
        session.visitor_name = request.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then modify the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
What is your name?
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

and the &quot;default/second.html&quot; view needs to retrieve the data from the ``session`` instead of from the ``request.vars``:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=session.visitor_name or &quot;anonymous&quot;}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

From the point of view of the visitor, the self-submission behaves exactly the same as the previous implementation. We have not added validation yet, but it is now clear that validation should be performed by the first action.

This approach is better also because the name of the visitor stays in the session, and can be accessed by all actions and views in the applications without having to be passed around explicitly.

Note that if the &quot;second&quot; action is ever called before a visitor name is set, it will display &quot;Hello anonymous&quot; because  ``session.visitor_name`` returns ``None``. Alternatively we could have added the following code in the controller (inside the ``second`` function):

``
if not request.function==&#x27;first&#x27; and not session.visitor_name:
    redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
``:code

This is a general mechanism that you can use to enforce authorization on controllers, though see Chapter 9 for a more powerful method.

``FORM``:inxx ``INPUT``:inxx ``requires``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx

With web2py we can move one step further and ask web2py to generate the form for us, including validation. web2py provides helpers (FORM, INPUT, TEXTAREA, and SELECT/OPTION) with the same names as the equivalent HTML tags. They can be used to build forms either in the controller or in the view.

For example, here is one possible way to rewrite the first action:
``
def first():
    form = FORM(INPUT(_name=&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
              INPUT(_type=&#x27;submit&#x27;))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

where we are saying that the FORM tag contains two INPUT tags. The attributes of the input tags are specified by the named arguments starting with underscore. The ``requires`` argument is not a tag attribute (because it does not start by underscore) but it sets a validator for the value of visitor_name.

Here is yet another better way to create the same form:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;,
                                 label=&#x27;what is your name?&#x27;,
                                 requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

The ``form`` object can be easily serialized in HTML by embedding it in the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view.
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=form}}
``:code

The ``form.process()`` method applies the validators and returns the form itself. The ``form.accepted`` variable is set to True if the form was processed and passed validation. If the self-submitted form passes validation, it stores the variables in the session and redirects as before. If the form does not pass validation, error messages are inserted into the form and shown to the user, as below:

[[image @///image/en1800.png center 480px]]

In the next section we will show how forms can be generated automatically from a model.

In all our examples we have used the session to pass the user name from the first action to the second. We could have used a different mechanism and passed data as part of a redirect URL:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;,vars=dict(name=name)))
    return dict(form=form)

def second():
    name = request.vars.visitor_name or redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
    return dict(name=name)
``:code

#### Internationalization

Your code is likely to include hardcoded strings such as &quot;What is your name?&quot;. You should be able to customize strings without editing the code and in particular insert translations for these strings in different languages. In this way if a visitor has the language preference of the browser set to &quot;Italian&quot;, web2py will use the Italian translation for the strings, if available. This feature of web2py is called &quot;internationalization&quot; and it is described in more detail in the next chapter.

Here we just observe that in order to use this feature you should markup strings that needs translation. This is done by wrapping a quoted string in code such as

``
&quot;What is your name?&quot;
``:code

with the ``T`` operator:

``
T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)
``:code


You can also mark for translations strings hardcoded in views. For example

``
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

becomes

``
&lt;h1&gt;{{=T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

It is good practice to do this for every string in the code (field labels, flash messages, etc.) except for tables and field names.

Once the strings are identified and marked up, web2py takes care of almost everything else. The admin interface also provides a page where you can translate each string in the languages you desire to support.

### An image blog
``upload``:inxx

Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments (posts).

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;post&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;email&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;))

db.image.title.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)
db.post.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
db.post.author.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()
db.post.email.requires = IS_EMAIL()
db.post.body.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()

db.post.image_id.writable = db.post.image_id.readable = False
``:code

Let&#x27;s analyze this line by line.

Line 1 defines a global variable called ``db`` that represents the database connection. In this case it is a connection to a SQLite database stored in the file  &quot;applications/images/databases/storage.sqlite&quot;. When using SQLite, if the database file does not exist, it is created. You can change the name of the file, as well as the name of the global variable ``db``, but it is convenient to give them the same name, to make it easy to remember.

Lines 3-5 define a table &quot;image&quot;. ``define_table`` is a method of the ``db`` object. The first argument, &quot;image&quot;, is the name of the table we are defining. The other arguments are the fields belonging to that table. This table has a field called &quot;title&quot;, a field called &quot;file&quot;, and a field called &quot;id&quot; that serves as the table primary key (&quot;id&quot; is not explicitly declared because all tables have an id field by default). The field &quot;title&quot; is a string, and the field &quot;file&quot; is of type &quot;upload&quot;. &quot;upload&quot; is a special type of field used by the web2py Data Abstraction Layer (DAL) to store the names of uploaded files. web2py knows how to upload files (via streaming if they are large), rename them safely, and store them.

When a table is defined, web2py takes one of several possible actions:
- if the table does not exist, the table is created;
- if the table exists and does not correspond to the definition, the table is altered accordingly, and if a field has a different type, web2py tries to convert its contents;
- if the table exists and corresponds to the definition, web2py does nothing.

This behavior is called &quot;migration&quot;. In web2py migrations are automatic, but can be disabled for each table by passing ``migrate=False`` as the last argument of ``define_table``.

Line 6 defines a format string for the table. It determines how a record should be represented as a string. Notice that the ``format`` argument can also be a function that takes a record and returns a string. For example:

``
format=lambda row: row.title
``:code

Lines 8-12 define another table called &quot;post&quot;.
A post has an &quot;author&quot;, an &quot;email&quot; (we intend to store the email address of the author of the post), a &quot;body&quot; of type &quot;text&quot; (we intend to use it to store the actual comment posted by the author), and an &quot;image_id&quot; field of type reference that points to ``db.image`` via the &quot;id&quot; field.

In line 14, ``db.image.title`` represents the field &quot;title&quot; of table &quot;image&quot;. The attribute ``requires`` allows you to set requirements/constraints that will be enforced by web2py forms. Here we require that the &quot;title&quot; is unique:

``IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)``:code

&#x27;&#x27;Notice this is optional because it is set automatically given that ``Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True)``&#x27;&#x27;.

The objects representing these constraints are called validators. Multiple validators can be grouped in a list. Validators are executed in the order they appear.
``IS_NOT_IN_DB(a, b)`` is a special validator that checks that the value of a field ``b`` for a new record is not already in ``a``.

Line 15 requires that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;post&quot; is in ``db.image.id``. As far as the database is concerned, we had already declared this  when we defined the table &quot;post&quot;.
Now we are explicitly telling the model that this condition should be enforced by web2py, too, at the form processing level when a new comment is posted, so that invalid values do not propagate from input forms to the database. We also require that the &quot;image_id&quot; be represented by the &quot;title&quot;, ``&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;``, of the corresponding record.

Line 20 indicates that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;post&quot; should not be shown in forms, ``writable=False`` and not even in read-only forms, ``readable=False``.

The meaning of the validators in lines 15-17 should be obvious.

``format``:inxx
Notice that the validator
``
db.post.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

can be omitted (and would be automatic) if we specify a format for referenced table:
``
db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;, ..., format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

where the format can be a string or a function that takes a record and returns a string.

``appadmin``:inxx
Once a model is defined, if there are no errors, web2py creates an application administration interface to manage the database. You access it via the &quot;database administration&quot; link in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page or directly:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/appadmin
``:code

Here is a screenshot of the **appadmin** interface:

[[image @///image/en2100.png center 480px]]

This interface is coded in the controller called &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and the corresponding view &quot;appadmin.html&quot;. From now on, we will refer to this interface simply as **appadmin**. It allows the administrator to insert new database records, edit and delete existing records, browse tables, and perform database joins.

The first time **appadmin** is accessed, the model is executed and the tables are created. The web2py DAL translates Python code into SQL statements that are specific to the selected database back-end (SQLite in this example). You can see the generated SQL from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page by clicking on the &quot;sql.log&quot; link under &quot;models&quot;. Notice that the link is not present until the tables have been created.

``:code


Lines 2-6 provide a comment for the index action. Lines 4-5 inside the comment are interpreted by python as test code (doctest). Tests can be run via the admin interface. In this case the tests verify that the index action runs without errors.

Lines 18, 27, and 35 try to fetch a ``page`` record with the id in
``request.args(0)``.

Lines 13, 20 define and process create forms for a new page and a new comment and

Line 28 defines and processes an update form for a wiki page.

Line 38 creates a ``grid`` object that allows to view, add and update the comments linked to a page.

Some magic happens in line 51. The ``onkeyup`` attribute of the INPUT tag &quot;keyword&quot; is set. Every time the visitor releases a key, the JavaScript code inside the ``onkeyup`` attribute is executed, client-side. Here is the JavaScript code:
``
ajax(&#x27;callback&#x27;, [&#x27;keyword&#x27;], &#x27;target&#x27;);
``:code
``ajax`` is a JavaScript function defined in the file &quot;web2py.js&quot; which is included by the default &quot;layout.html&quot;. It takes three parameters: the URL of the action that performs the synchronous callback, a list of the IDs of variables to be sent to the callback ([&quot;keyword&quot;]), and the ID where the response has to be inserted (&quot;target&quot;).

As soon as you type something in the search box and release a key, the client calls the server and sends the content of the &#x27;keyword&#x27; field, and, when the sever responds, the response is embedded in the page itself as the innerHTML of the &#x27;target&#x27; tag.

The &#x27;target&#x27; tag is a DIV defined in line 52. It could have been defined in the view as well.

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/create.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Create new wiki page&lt;/h1&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

Assuming you are registered and logged in, if you visit the **create** page, you see the following:

[[image @///image/en3500.png center 480px]]
Here is the code for the view &quot;default/index.html&quot;:
     {{=LI(A(page.title, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=page.id)))}}
{{pass}}&lt;/ul&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;create page&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;create&#x27;))}} ]
``:code

It generates the following page:

[[image @///image/en3600.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;:

``markdown``:inxx ``MARKMIN``:inxx
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;{{=page.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;edit&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;edit&#x27;, args=request.args))}}
| {{=A(&#x27;documents&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;documents&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
{{for post in comments:}}
  &lt;p&gt;{{=db.auth_user[post.created_by].first_name}} on {{=post.created_on}}
     says &lt;i&gt;{{=post.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

If you wish to use markdown syntax instead of markmin syntax:

``
from gluon.contrib.markdown import WIKI
``:code

and use ``WIKI`` instead of the ``MARKMIN`` helper.
Alternatively, you can choose to accept raw HTML instead of markmin syntax. In this case you would replace:
``
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
``:code

with:
``
{{=XML(page.body)}}
``:code

``sanitize``:inxx
(so that the XML does not get escaped, which web2py normally does by default for security reasons).

This can be done better with:
``
{{=XML(page.body, sanitize=True)}}
``:code

By setting ``sanitize=True``, you tell web2py to escape unsafe XML tags such as &quot;&lt;script&gt;&quot;, and thus prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Now if, from the index page, you click on a page title, you can see the page that you have created:

[[image @///image/en3700.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/edit.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Edit wiki page&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;show&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=form}}
If you look at the page source you see the HTML returned by the callback:
Generating an RSS feed of your wiki pages using web2py is easy because web2py includes ``gluon.contrib.rss2``. Just append the following action to the default controller:
``
def news():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;generates rss feed form the wiki pages&quot;&quot;&quot;
    response.generic_patterns = [&#x27;.rss&#x27;]
    pages = db().select(db.page.ALL, orderby=db.page.title)
    return dict(
       title = &#x27;mywiki rss feed&#x27;,
       link = &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/index&#x27;,
       description = &#x27;mywiki news&#x27;,
       created_on = request.now,
       items = [
          dict(title = row.title,
               link = URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=row.id),
               description = MARKMIN(row.body).xml(),
               created_on = row.created_on
               ) for row in pages])
``:code

and when you visit the page
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/news.rss
``:code

you see the feed (the exact output depends on the feed reader). Notice that the dict is automatically converted to RSS, thanks to the .rss extension in the URL.

[[image @///image/en4000.png center 480px]]

web2py also includes feedparser to read third-party feeds.

``XMLRPC``:inxx
Finally, let&#x27;s add an XML-RPC handler that allows searching the wiki programmatically:
``
service = Service()

@service.xmlrpc
def find_by(keyword):
     &quot;&quot;&quot;finds pages that contain keyword for XML-RPC&quot;&quot;&quot;
     return db(db.page.title.contains(keyword)).select().as_list()

def call():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;exposes all registered services, including XML-RPC&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return service()
``:code

Here, the handler action simply publishes (via XML-RPC), the functions specified in the list. In this case, ``find_by``. ``find_by`` is not an action (because it takes an argument). It queries the database with ``.select()`` and then extracts the records as a list with ``.response`` and returns the list.

Here is an example of how to access the XML-RPC handler from an external
Python program.
``
&gt;&gt;&gt; import xmlrpclib
&gt;&gt;&gt; server = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(
    &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/call/xmlrpc&#x27;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in server.find_by(&#x27;wiki&#x27;):
        print item[&#x27;created_on&#x27;], item[&#x27;title&#x27;]
``:code

The handler can be accessed from many other programming languages that understand XML-RPC, including C, C++, C# and Java.

#### On ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time`` format
yet this representation is internationalized and you can use the admin translati
Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications are written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need to declare that the application&#x27;s current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide an example of the built-in web2py wiki.

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

------
Notice the API of the built-in wiki is still considered experimental and small changes are still possible.
------

Here we assume we are starting from scratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged-in as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is understood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You can make your own view for this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. There is no need to call the action &quot;index&quot;.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you to create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have URLs like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_create

Try to create more pages such as &quot;index&quot;, &quot;aboutus&quot;, and &quot;contactus&quot;.
Try to edit them.


The ``wiki`` method has the following signature:

``
def wiki(self, slug=None, env=None, render=&#x27;markmin&#x27;,
         manage_permissions=False, force_prefix=&#x27;&#x27;,
         restrict_search=False, resolve=True,
         extra=None, menugroups=None)
``:code

It takes the following arguments:

- ``render`` which defaults to ``&#x27;markmin&#x27;`` but can be set equal to ``&#x27;html&#x27;``. It determines the syntax of the wiki. We will discuss the markmin wiki markup later. If you change it to HTML you may want to use a wysiwyg javascript editor such as TinyMCE or NicEdit.
- ``manage_permissions``. This is set to ``False`` by default and only recognizes permissions for &quot;wiki-editor&quot; and &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you change it to ``True`` the create/edit page will give the option to specify by names the group(s) whose members have permission to read and edit the page. There is a group &quot;everybody&quot; which includes all users.

- ``force_prefix``. If set to something like ``&#x27;%(id)s-&#x27;`` it will restrict authors (not editors) to creating pages with a prefix like &quot;[user id]-[page name]&quot;. The prefix can contain the id (&quot;%(id)s&quot;) or the username (&quot;%(username)s&quot;) or any other field from the auth_user table, as long as the corresponding column contains valid string that would pass URL validation.
- ``restrict_search``. This defaults to ``False`` and any logged-in user can search all wiki pages (but not necessary read or edit them). If set to ``True``, authors can search only their own pages, editors can search everything, other users cannot search anything.
- ``menugroups``. This defaults to ``None`` and it indicates that wiki management menu (search, create, edit, etc.) is always displayed. You can set it to a list of group names whose members only can see this menu, for example ``[&#x27;wiki-editor&#x27;,&#x27;wiki-author&#x27;]``. Notice that even if the menu is exposed to everybody that does not mean everybody is allowed to perform actions listed in the menu since they are regulated by the access control system.

The ``wiki`` method has some additional parameters which will be explained later: ``slug``, ``env``, and ``extra``.



#### MARKMIN basics

The MARKMIN syntax allows you to markup **bold** text using ``**bold**``, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27; text with ``&#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;``, ``code`` text with ``\`\`code\`\```. Titles must be prefixed by a #, sections by ##, and sub-sections by ###. Use a minus(-) to prefix an un-ordered item and plus(+) to prefix an ordered item. URLs are automatically converted into links. For example:

``
# This is a title
## this is a section title
### this is a subsection title

Text can be **bold**, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;, !`!!`!code!`!!`! etc.
Learn more at:

http://web2py.com
``:code


You can use the ``extra`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to pass extra rendering rules to the MARKMIN helper.

You can find more information about the MARKMIN syntax in chapter 5.

``auth.wiki`` is more powerful than the barebones MARKMIN helpers, supporting oembed and components.

You can use the ``env`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to expose functions to your wiki.
For example:

``
auth.wiki(env=dict(join=lambda a,b,c:&quot;%s-%s-%s&quot; % (a,b,c)))
``

allows you to use the markup syntax:

``
@(join:1,2,3)
Supported by oembed:

``
flickr.com
youtube.com
hulu.com
vimeo.com
slideshare.net
qik.com
polleverywhere.com
wordpress.com
revision3.com
viddler.com
``:code

This is implemented in the web2py file ``gluon.contrib.autolinks`` and specifically in the function ``expand_one``. You can extend oembed support by registering more services. This is done by appending an entry to the ``EMBED_MAPS`` list:

``
from gluon.contrib.autolinks import EMBED_MAPS
EMBED_MAPS.append((re.compile(&#x27;http://vimeo.com/\S*&#x27;),
                   &#x27;http://vimeo.com/api/oembed.json&#x27;))
``:code

#### Referencing wiki content

If you create a wiki page with slug &quot;contactus&quot; you can refer to this page as

``
\@////contactus
``:code

Here ``\@////`` stands for

``
\@/app/controller/function/
``:code

but &quot;app&quot;, &quot;controller&quot;, and &quot;function&quot; are omitted thus assuming default.

Similarly you can use the wiki menu to upload a media file (for example an image) linked to the page. The &quot;manage media&quot; page will show all files you have uploaded and will show the proper expression to link the media file. If, for example you upload a file &quot;test.jpg&quot; with title &quot;beach&quot;, the link expression will something like:

``
\@////15/beach.jpg
``:code

``\@////`` is the same prefix described before. ``15`` is the id of the record storing the media file. ``beach`` is the title. ``.jpg`` is the extension of the original file.

If you cut and paste ``\@////15/beach.jpg`` into wiki pages you embed the image.

Mind that media files are linked to pages and inherit access permission from the pages.

#### Wiki menus

If you create a page with slug &quot;wiki-menu&quot; page it will be interpreted as a description of the menu. Here is an example:

``
- Home &gt; \@////index
- Info &gt; \@////info
- web2py &gt; http://google.com
- - About us &gt; \@////aboutus
- - Contact us &gt; \@////contactus
``
Another customization possible is adding extra fields to the standard wiki table
auth.settings.extra_fields[&quot;wiki_page&quot;] = [Field(&quot;ablob&quot;, &quot;blob&quot;),]
``:code

The line above adds a ``blob`` field to the ``wiki_page`` table. There is no need to call ``auth.wiki(resolve=False)``:code for this option, unless you need access to the wiki model for other customizations.


#### Components

One of the most powerful functions of the new web2py consists in the ability of embedding an action inside another action. We call this a component.

Consider the following model:

``
db.define_table(&#x27;thing&#x27;,Field(&#x27;name&#x27;,requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
``:code

and the following action:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage_things():
    return SQLFORM.grid(db.thing)
``:code

This action is special because it returns a widget/helper not a dict of objects. Now we can embed this ``manage_things`` action into any view, with

``
{{=LOAD(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;manage_things&#x27;,ajax=True)}}
``:code

This allows the visitor interact with the component via Ajax without reloading the host page that embeds the widget. Basically the action is called via Ajax, inherits the style of the host page, and captures all form submissions and flash messages so that they are handled within the current page. On top of this the ``SQLFORM.grid`` widget uses digitally signed URLs to restrict access. More information about components can be found in chapter 13.

Components like the one above can be embedded into wiki pages using the MARKMIN syntax:

``
@{component:default/manage_things}
``

This simply tells web2py that we want to include the &quot;manage_things&quot; action defined in the &quot;default&quot; controller as an Ajax &quot;component&quot;.

---------
Most users will be able to build relatively complex applications simply by using ``auth.wiki`` to create pages and menus and embedded custom components into wiki pages. Wikis can be thought of as a mechanism to allow members of the group to create pages, but they can also be thought of as a way to develop applications in a modular way.
---------

### More on **admin**
``admin``:inxx

The administrative interface provides additional functionality that we briefly review here.

#### Site
``site``:inxx

This page is the main administrative interface of web2py. It lists all installed applications on the left, while on the right side there are some special action forms.

The first of them shows the web2py version and proposes to upgrade it if new versions are available. Of course, before upgrading be sure to have a full working backup!
Then there are two other forms that allow the creation of a new application (simple or by using an online wizard) by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The following form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it (using different names
allows you to install multiple copies of the same application). You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

http://mercurial.selenic.com/

The **admin** interface includes a Wizard that can help you create a new applications.
You can access the wizard from the &quot;sites&quot; page as shown in the image below.

[[image @///image/en5400.png center 480px]]

The wizard will guide you through a series of steps involved in creating a new application:

- Chose a name for the application
- Configure the application and choose required plugins
- Build required models (it will create CRUD pages for each model)
- Allow you to edit the views of those pages using MARKMIN syntax

The image below shows the second step of the process.

[[image @///image/en5500.png center 480px]]

You can see a dropdown to select a layout plugin (from ``web2py.com/layouts``), a multiple choice dropdown to check other plugins (from ``web2py.com/plugins``) and a &quot;login config&quot; field where to put the Janrain &quot;domain:key&quot;.

The other steps are pretty much self-explanatory.

The Wizard works well for what it does but it is considered an &#x27;&#x27;experimental feature&#x27;&#x27; for two reasons:

- Applications created with the wizard and edited manually, cannot later be modified by the wizard.
- The interface of the wizard will change over time to include support for more features and easier visual development.

In any case the wizard is a handy tool for fast prototyping and it can be used to bootstrap a new application with an alternate layout and optional plugins.

#### Configuring **admin**

Normally there is no need to perform any configuration of admin but a few customizations are possible. After you login into admin you can edit the admin configuration file via the URL:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/edit/admin/models/0.py
``
Notice that **admin** can be used to edit itself. In fact **admin** is an app as any other one.

The file &quot;0.py&quot; is very much self documented and if you are opening probably you already know what you are looking for. Anyway a few customizations exist that are more important than others:

``
GAE_APPCFG = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(&#x27;/usr/local/bin/appcfg.py&#x27;))
``
This should point to the location of the &quot;appcfg.py&quot; file that comes with the Google App Engine SDK. If you have the SDK you may want to change these config parameters to the correct value. It will allow you to deploy to GAE from the admin interface.

``DEMO_MODE``:inxx

You can also set web2py admin in demo mode:
``
DEMO_MODE = True
FILTER_APPS = [&#x27;welcome&#x27;]
``
And only the apps listed in filter apps will be accessible and they will be only accessible in read-only mode.

``MULTI_USER_MODE``:inxx
``virtual laboratory``:inxx

If you are a teacher and want to expose the administrative interface to students so that students can share one administrative interface for their projects (think of a virtual lab), can do it by setting:
``
MULTI_USER_MODE = True
``
In this way students will be required to login and will only be able to access their own apps via admin. You, as first user/teacher, will be able to access them all.

In multi user mode, you can register students using the &quot;bulk register&quot; link in admin and manage them using the &quot;manage students&quot; link. The system also keeps track of when students login and how many lines of code they add/remove to/from their code. This data is presented to the administrator as charts under the application &quot;about&quot; page.

Mind that this mechanism still assumes all users are trusted. All the apps created under admin run under the same credentials on the same filesystem. It is possible for an app created by a student to access the data and the source of an app created by another student. It is also possible for a student to create an app that locks the server.

#### Mobile **admin**

Notice that the admin application includes &quot;plugin_jqmobile&quot; which packages jQuery Mobile. When admin is accessed from a mobile device; this is detected by web2py and the interface is displayed using a mobile-friendly layout.

``wiki``:inxx ``RSS``:inxx ``Ajax``:inxx ``XMLRPC``:inxx

In this section, we build a simple wiki from scratch using only low level APIs (as opposed to using the built-in wiki capabilities of web2py demonstrated in the next section). The visitor will be able to create pages, search them (by title), and edit them. The visitor will also be able to post comments (exactly as in the previous applications), and also post documents (as attachments to the pages) and link them from the pages. As a convention, we adopt the Markmin syntax for our wiki syntax. We will also implement a search page with Ajax, an RSS feed for the pages, and a handler to search the pages via XML-RPC``xmlrpc``:cite .

The following diagram lists the actions that we need to implement and the links we intend to build among them.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en3400.png center 250px]]

Start by creating a new scaffolding app, naming it &quot;mywiki&quot;.

The model must contain three tables: page, comment, and document. Both comment and document reference page because they belong to page. A document contains a file field of type upload as in the previous images application.

Here is the complete model:
``
db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)

from gluon.tools import *
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
crud = Crud(db)

db.define_table(&#x27;page&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;title&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id))
The handler can be accessed from many other programming languages that understan
There are three different representation for each of the field types ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time``:
- the database representation
- the internal web2py prepresentation
- the string representation in forms and tables

The database representation is an internal issue and does not affect the code. Internally, at the web2py level, they are stored as ``datetime.date``, ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.time`` object respectively and they can be manipulated as such:

``
for page in db(db.page).select():
    print page.title, page.day, page.month, page.year
``

When dates are converted to strings in forms they are converted using the ISO representation 
``
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
``

yet this representation in internationalized and you can use the admin stranslation page to change the format to an alternate one. For example:

``
%m/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S
``

------
Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications is already written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need declare that the application current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``
------

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide and example of the built-in web2py wiki.

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

Here we assume we are starting from cratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is undesrtood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You man make your own view for the this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. There is no need to call the action &quot;index&quot;.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have RULS like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_create
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_search
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_could
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_recent
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_edit/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_editmedia/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_preview/...
``

Try create more pages such as &quot;index&quot;, &quot;aboutus&quot;, and &quot;contactus&quot;.
Try edit them. 


The ``wiki`` method takes some optional arguments:

- ``render`` which defaults to ``&#x27;markmin&#x27;`` but can be set equal to ``&#x27;html&#x27;``. It termines the syntax of the wiki. We will discuss the makrmin wiki markup later. If you change it to HTML you may want to use a wysiwyg javascript editor such as TinyMCE of NicEdit.
- ``manage_permissions``. This is set to ``False`` by default and only recognizes permissions for &quot;wiki-editor&quot; and &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you change it to ``True`` the create/edit page will give the option to specify by names the groups whose members have permssion to read and edit the page. In this case is a group &quot;everybody&quot; to give read permission to everybody.
- ``force_prefix``. If set to something like ``&#x27;%(id)s-&#x27;`` it will restict authors (not editors) to create page with a prefix like &quot;[user id]-[page name]&quot;. The prefix can contain the id (&quot;%(id)s&quot;) or the username (&quot;%(username)s&quot;) or any other field from the auth_user table, as long as the corresponding column contains valid string that would pass URL validation.
- ``restrict_search``. This default to ``False`` and any logged-in user can search all wiki pages (but not necessary read or edit them). If set to ``True``, authors can search only their own pages, editors can search everything, other users cannot search anything.
- ``menugroups``. This defaults to ``None`` and it indictates that wiki management menu (search, create, edit, etc.) is always displayed. You can set it to a list of group names whose members only can see this menu, for exmaple ``[&#x27;wiki-editor&#x27;,&#x27;wiki-author&#x27;]``. Notice that even if the menu is exposed to everybody does not mean everybody is allowed to perform actions listed in the menu since they are regulated by the access control system.

The ``wiki`` method has some additional parameters which will be explained later: ``slug``, ``env``, and ``extra``.



#### MARKMIN basics

The MARKMIN syntax allows you to markup **bold** text using ``**bold**``, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27; text with ``&#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;``, ``code`` text with ``\`\`code\`\```. Titles must be prefixed by a #, sections by ##, and sub-sections by ###. Use a minus(-) to prefix an un-ordered item and plus(+) to prefix an ordered item. URLs are automatically into links. For example:

``
# This is title
## this is a section title
### this is a subsection title

Text can be **bold**, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;, !`!!`!code!`!!`! etc.
Learn more at:

http://web2py.com
``:code


You can use the ``extra`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to pass extra rendering rules to the MARKMIN helper. For example:

``
auth.wiki(extra=dict(verbatim=lambda text: verbatim))
``

In the varbatim function will preprocess all the input marked as varbatim

``
!`!!`!
hello world
!`!!`!:verbatim
``

You can find more information about the MARKMIN syntax in chapter 5.
``auth.wiki`` is more powerful than the barebone MARKMIN helpers. In fact it supports oembed and components.

You can use theS ``env`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to expose functions to your wiki.
For example:

``
auth.wiki(env=dict(join=lambda a,b,c:&quot;%s-%s-%s&quot; % (a,b,c)))
``

allows you to use the markup syntax:

``
@(join:1,2,3)
``


This call the join function passed as extra with parameters ``a,b,c=1,2,3`` and will be redered as ``1-2-3``.

#### Oembed protocol

You can type in (or cut-and-paste) any URL into a wiki page it normally is rendered as a link to the URL. There are exceptions:

- If the URL has an image extension, the link is embedded as an image, ``&lt;img/&gt;``.
- If the URL has an audio extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 audio ``&lt;audio/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a video extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 video ``&lt;video/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a MS Office or PDF extension, Google Doc Viewer is embedded, showing the content of the document (only works for public documents).
- If the URL points to a Youtube page, a Viemo page, or a Flickr page, web2py contacts the corrsponding web service and queries it about the propor way to embed the contect. This is done using the ``oembed`` protocol.

Here is a complete list of supported formats:
``
Image (.PNG, .GIF, .JPG, .JPEG)
Audio (.WAV, .OGG, .MP3)
Video (.MOV, .MPE, .MP4, .MPG, .MPG2, .MPEG, .MPEG4, .MOVIE)

``

This is implemeneted in the web2py file ``gluon.contrib.autolinks`` and specifically in the function ``expand_one``. You can extend oembed support by registering more services. This is done by appending an entry to the ``EMBED_MAPS`` list:

``
from gluon.contrib.autlinks import EMBED_MAPS
EMBED_MAPS.append((re.compile(&#x27;http://vimeo.com/\S*&#x27;),
                   &#x27;http://vimeo.com/api/oembed.json&#x27;))
``:code

#### Referencing wiki content

If you create a wiki page with slug &quot;contactus&quot; you can refer to this page as

``
@////contactus
``:code

Here ``@////`` stands for

``
@/app/controller/function/
``:code

but &quot;app&quot;, &quot;controller&quot;, and &quot;function&quot; are omitted thus assuming default.

Similarly you can use the wiki menu to upload a media file (for example an image) linked to the page. The &quot;manage media&quot; page will show all files you have uploaded and will show the proper expression to link the media file. If, for example you upload a file &quot;test.jpg&quot; with title &quot;beach&quot;, the link expression will somthing like:

``
@////15/beach.jpg
``:code

``@////`` is the same prefix described before. ``15`` is the id of the record storing the media file. ``beach`` is the title. ``.jpg`` is the extension of the original file.

If you cut and paste ``@////15/beach.jpg`` into wiki pages you embed the image.

Mind that media files are linked to pages and inherit access permission from the pages.

#### Wiki menus

If you create a page with slug &quot;wiki-menu&quot; page it will be interpreted as a description of the menu. Here is an example:

``
- Home &gt; @////index
- Info &gt; @////info
- web2py &gt; http://google.com
- - About us &gt; @////aboutus
- - Countact us &gt; @////contactus
``

Each line a menu item. We used double dash for nested menu ites. The ``&gt;`` symbols separates the menu item title from the menu item link.

Mind that the menu is appended to ``response.menu``. It does not replace it. The ``[wiki]`` menu tem with service functions is added automatically.

#### Service functions

If, for example, you want to use the wiki to create an editable sidebar you could create a page with ``slug=&quot;sidebar&quot;`` and then embed it in your layout.html with

``
{{=auth.wiki(slug=&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)}}
``:code

Notice that there is nothing special with the word &quot;sidebar&quot;. Any wiki page can be retrieved and emebdded in any point in your code. This allows you mix and match wiki functionalities with regular web2py functionalities.

You can also embed special wiki functions as the search by tags:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_search&#x27;)}}
``:code

or the tag cloud:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_cloud&#x27;)}}
``:code

#### Components

One of the most powerful function of the new web2py consists in the ability of embedding an action inside another action. We call this a component.

Consider the following model:

``
db.define_table(&#x27;thing&#x27;,Field(&#x27;name&#x27;,requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
``:code

and the following action:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage_things():
    return SQLFORM.grid(db.thing)
``:code

This action is special because it returns a widget/helper not a dict of objects. Now we can embed this ``manage_things`` action into any view, with

``
{{=LOAD(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;manage_things&#x27;,ajax=True)}}
``:code

This allows the visitor interact with the component via Ajax without reloadin the host page that embeds the widget. Basically the action is called via Ajax, inherits the stile of the host page, and capture all forms submissions and flash messages so that thye are handled within the current page. On top of this the ``SQLFORM.grid`` widget uses digitally signed URLs to restrict access. More informaiton about components can be found in chapter 13.

Components like the one above can be embedded into wiki pages using the MARKMIN syntax:

``
@{component:default/manage_things}
``

This simply tells web2py that we want to incude the &quot;manage_things&quot; action defined in the &quot;default&quot; controller as an Ajax &quot;component&quot;.

---------
Most users will be able to build relatively complex applications simply by using ``auth.wiki`` to create pages and menus, and embedded custom components into wiki pages. Wiki can be tough as a mechanism to allow members of the group to create pages but they calso be though as a way to develop applications in a modular way.

In web2py you can create a complete Wiki with tags, tag could, search, media files, and oembed support using only one line of code:

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

This function is documented later in this book and can be used to add a wiki to any existing application.

In this section, we build a wiki from scratch using only low level APIs. The visitor will be able to create pages, search them (by title), and edit them. The visitor will also be able to post comments (exactly as in the previous applications), and also post documents (as attachments to the pages) and link them from the pages. As a convention, we adopt the Markmin syntax for our wiki syntax. We will also implement a search page with Ajax, an RSS feed for the pages, and a handler to search the pages via XML-RPC``xmlrpc``:cite .

The following diagram lists the actions that we need to implement and the links we intend to build among them.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en3400.png center 250px]]

Start by creating a new scaffolding app, naming it &quot;mywiki&quot;.

The model must contain three tables: page, comment, and document. Both comment and document reference page because they belong to page. A document contains a file field of type upload as in the previous images application.

Here is the complete model:
``
db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)

from gluon.tools import *
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
crud = Crud(db)

db.define_table(&#x27;page&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;title&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id))
The handler can be accessed from many other programming languages that understan
There are three different representation for each of the field types ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time``:
- the database representation
- the internal web2py prepresentation
- the string representation in forms and tables

The database representation is an internal issue and does not affect the code. Internally, at the web2py level, they are stored as ``datetime.date``, ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.time`` object respectively and they can be manipulated as such:

``
for page in db(db.page).select():
    print page.title, page.day, page.month, page.year
``

When dates are converted to strings in forms they are converted using the ISO representation 
``
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
``

yet this representation in internationalized and you can use the admin stranslation page to change the format to an alternate one. For example:

``
%m/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S
``

------
Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications is already written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need declare that the application current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``

    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #DFF0D8;">The **edit** page tells you what is inside the application.
Every web2py application consists of certain files, most of which fall into one of six categories:
- **models**: describe the data representation.
- **controllers**: describe the application logic and workflow.
- **views**: describe the data presentation.
- **languages**: describe how to translate the application presentation to other languages.
- **modules**: Python modules that belong to the application.
- **static files**: static images, CSS  files``css:w,css:o,css:school``:cite , JavaScript files``js:w,js:b``:cite , etc.
- **plugins**: groups of files designed to work together.
 
Everything is neatly organized following the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Each section in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page corresponds to a subfolder in the application folder.

Notice that section headings will toggle their content. Folder names under static files are also collapsible.

-------
Each file listed in the section corresponds to a file physically located in the subfolder. Any operation performed on a file via the **admin** interface (create, edit, delete) can be performed directly from the shell using your favorite editor.
-------

The application contains other types of files (database, session files, error files, etc.), but they are not listed on the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page because they are not created or modified by the administrator; they are created and modified by the application itself.

The controllers contain the logic and workflow of the application. Every URL gets mapped into a call to one of the functions in the controllers (actions). There are two default controllers: &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and &quot;default.py&quot;. **appadmin** provides the database administrative interface; we do not need it now. &quot;default.py&quot; is the controller that you need to edit, the one that is called by default when no controller is specified in the URL. Edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def index():
    return &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;
``:code

Here is what the online editor looks like:

[[image @///image/en1000.png center 480px]]

Save it and go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. Click on the index link to visit the newly created page.

http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/default/index
the index action in the default controller of the myapp application is called. It returns a string that the browser displays for us. It should look like this:

[[image @///image/en1100.png center 480px]]

Now, edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def index():
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;)
``:code

Also from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page, edit the view &quot;default/index.html&quot; (the view file associated with the action) and completely replace the existing contents of that file with the following:
``
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{=message}}&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
``:code

Now the action returns a dictionary defining a ``message``. When an action returns a dictionary, web2py looks for a view with the name

``[controller]/[function].[extension]``:code

 and executes it. Here [extension] is the requested extension. If no extension is specified, it defaults to &quot;html&quot;, and that is what we will assume here. Under this assumption, the view is an HTML file that embeds Python code using special {{ }} tags. In particular, in the example, the ``{{=message}}`` instructs web2py to replace the tagged code with the value of the ``message`` returned by the action. Notice that ``message`` here is not a web2py keyword but is defined in the action. So far we have not used any web2py keywords.

If web2py does not find the requested view, it uses the &quot;generic.html&quot; view that comes with every application.

-------
``Mac Mail``:inxx ``Google Maps``:inxx ``jsonp``:inxx
If an extension other than &quot;html&quot; is specified (&quot;json&quot; for example), and the view file &quot;[controller]/[function].json&quot; is not found, web2py looks for the view &quot;generic.json&quot;. web2py comes with generic.html, generic.json, generic.jsonp, generic.xml, generic.rss, generic.ics (for Mac Mail Calendar), generic.map (for embedding Google Maps), and generic.pdf (based on fpdf). These generic views can be modified for each application individually, and additional views can be added easily.

Everything is neatly organized following the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Each section in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page corresponds to a subfolder in the application folder.

Notice that section headings will toggle their content. Folder names under static files are also collapsible.

-------
Each file listed in the section corresponds to a file physically located in the subfolder. Any operation performed on a file via the **admin** interface (create, edit, delete) can be performed directly from the shell using your favorite editor.
-------

The application contains other types of files (database, session files, error files, etc.), but they are not listed on the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page because they are not created or modified by the administrator; they are created and modified by the application itself.

The controllers contain the logic and workflow of the application. Every URL gets mapped into a call to one of the functions in the controllers (actions). There are two default controllers: &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and &quot;default.py&quot;. **appadmin** provides the database administrative interface; we do not need it now. &quot;default.py&quot; is the controller that you need to edit, the one that is called by default when no controller is specified in the URL. Edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def index():
    return &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;
``:code

Here is what the online editor looks like:

[[image @///image/en1000.png center 480px]]

Save it and go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. Click on the index link to visit the newly created page.

http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/default/index
the index action in the default controller of the myapp application is called. It returns a string that the browser displays for us. It should look like this:

[[image @///image/en1100.png center 480px]]

Now, edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def index():
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;)
``:code

Also from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page, edit the view &quot;default/index.html&quot; (the view file associated with the action) and completely replace the existing contents of that file with the following:
``
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{=message}}&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
``:code

Now the action returns a dictionary defining a ``message``. When an action returns a dictionary, web2py looks for a view with the name

``[controller]/[function].[extension]``:code

 and executes it. Here [extension] is the requested extension. If no extension is specified, it defaults to &quot;html&quot;, and that is what we will assume here. Under this assumption, the view is an HTML file that embeds Python code using special {{ }} tags. In particular, in the example, the ``{{=message}}`` instructs web2py to replace the tagged code with the value of the ``message`` returned by the action. Notice that ``message`` here is not a web2py keyword but is defined in the action. So far we have not used any web2py keywords.

If web2py does not find the requested view, it uses the &quot;generic.html&quot; view that comes with every application.

-------
``Mac Mail``:inxx ``Google Maps``:inxx ``jsonp``:inxx
If an extension other than &quot;html&quot; is specified (&quot;json&quot; for example), and the view file &quot;[controller]/[function].json&quot; is not found, web2py looks for the view &quot;generic.json&quot;. web2py comes with generic.html, generic.json, generic.jsonp, generic.xml, generic.rss, generic.ics (for Mac Mail Calendar), generic.map (for embedding Google Mpas), and generic.pdf (based on fpdf). These generic views can be modified for each application individually, and additional views can be added easily.

<div class="row-fluid" id="com_e8fd4a9f6c469c6a15492805add99a8a2a1cbf92">
    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #DFF0D8;">This page is the main administrative interface of web2py. It lists all installed applications on the left, while on the right side there are some special action forms.

The first of them shows the web2py version and proposes to upgrade it if new versions are available. Of course, before upgrading be sure to have a full working backup!
Then there are two forms that allows creating a new application (simple or by using an online wizard) by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The following form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it (using different names
allows you to install multiple copies of the same application). You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or Instant Press CMS created by Martin Mulone:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or one of the many example applications available at:

``
http://web2py.com/appliances
``

------
Web2py files are packages as ``.w2p`` files. These ones are tar gzipped files. Web2py uses the ``.w2p`` extension instead of the ``.tgz`` extension to prevent the browser from unzipping on download. They can be uncompressed manually with ``tar zxvf [filename]`` although this is never necessary.
------

[[image @///image/en4100.png center 444px]]

Upon successful upload, web2py displays the MD5 checksum of the uploaded file. You can use it to verify that the file was not corrupted during upload. The InstantPress name will appear in the list of installed applications.

If you run web2py from source and you have ``gitpython`` installed (if necessary, set it up with &#x27;easy_install gitpython&#x27;), you can install applications directly from git repositories
using the ``.git`` URL in the upload form. In this case you will also be enabled to use the admin interface to push changes back into the repository, but this is an experimental feature.

For example, you can locally install the application that shows this book on the web2py site with the URL:

``
https://github.com/mdipierro/web2py-book.git
``

------
That repository hosts the current, updated version of this book (which could be different from the stable version you can see on the web site). You are warmly invited to use it for submitting
improvements, fixes and corrections in the form of pull requests.
------
  
For each application installed you can use the &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page to:
- Go directly to the application by clicking on its name.
- Uninstall the application.
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Clean up temporary files (sessions, errors, and cache.disk files).
- Pack all. This returns a tar file containing a complete copy of the application. We suggest that you clean up temporary files before packing an application.
- Compile the application. If there are no errors, this option will bytecode-compile all models, controllers and views. Because views can extend and include other views in a tree, before bytecode compilation, the view tree for every controller is collapsed into a single file. The net effect is that a bytecode-compiled application is faster, because there is no more parsing of templates or string substitutions occurring at runtime.
- Pack compiled. This option is only present for bytecode-compiled applications. It allows packing the application without source code for distribution as closed source. Note that Python (as any other programming language) can technically be decompiled; therefore compilation does not provide complete protection of the source code. Nevertheless, decompilation can be difficult and can be illegal.
- Remove compiled. It simply removes the byte-code compiled models, views and controllers from the application. If the application was packaged with source code or edited locally, there is no harm in removing the bytecode-compiled files, and the application will continue to work. If the application was installed form a packed compiled file, then this is not safe, because there is no source code to revert to, and the application will no longer work.

``admin.py``:inxx

-------
All the functionality available from the web2py admin site page is also accessible programmatically via the API defined in the module ``gluon/admin.py``. Simply open a python shell and import this module.
-------

If the Google App Engine SDK is installer the admin &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page shows a button to push your applications to GAE. If ``python-git`` is installed, there is also a button to push your application to Open Shift. To install applications on ``Heroku`` or other hosting system you should look into the &quot;scripts&quot; folder for the appropriate script.

#### About
``about``:inxx ``license``:inxx

The &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; tab allows editing the description of the application and its license. These are written respectively in the ABOUT and LICENSE files in the application folder.

[[image @///image/en4300.png center 480px]]

You can use ``MARKMIN``, or ``gluon.contrib.markdown.WIKI`` syntax for these files as described in ref.``markdown2``:cite .

#### Design
``EDIT``:inxx
You have used the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page already in this chapter. Here we want to point out a few more functionalities of the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page.
If you fix the divide-by-zero bug in the index action and introduce one in the i
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}

&lt;h1&gt;Current Images&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{{for image in images:}}
{{1/0}}
{{=LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&quot;show&quot;, args=image.id)))}}
{{pass}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en5000.png center 480px]]

Note that web2py has converted the view from HTML into a Python file, and the error described in the ticket refers to the generated Python code and NOT to the original view file:

[[image @///image/en5100.png center 480px]]

This may seem confusing at first, but in practice it makes debugging easier, because the Python indentation highlights the logical structure of the code that you embedded in the views.

The code is shown at the bottom of the same page.

All tickets are listed under admin in the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page for each application:

[[image @///image/en5200.png center 480px]]

#### Mercurial
``Mercurial``:inxx

If you are running from source, the administrative interface shows one more menu item called &quot;Versioning&quot;. 

[[images @///image/en5300.png center 480px]]

Entering a comment and pressing the &quot;commit&quot; button in the resulting page will commit the current application. With the first commit, a local Mercurial repository for the specific 
application will be created. 
Under the hood, Mercurial stores information about changes you make in your code into a hidden folder &quot;.hg&quot; in your app subfolder. Every app has its own &quot;.hg&quot; folder and its own &quot;.hgignore&quot; file (tells Mercurial which files to ignore).
In order to use this feature, you must have the Mercurial version control libraries installed (at least version 1.9):


``
easy_install mercurial
``:code

The Mercurial web interface does allow you to browse previous commit and diff files but we do recommend you use Mercurial directly from the shell or one of the many GUI-based Mercurial clients since they are more powerful. For example they will allow you sync your app with a remote source repository:

</pre></div>
    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #F2DEDE;">This page lists all installed applications. There are two forms at the bottom.

The first of them allows creating a new application by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The second form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it. This can be its original name, but does not need to be. This allows installing multiple copies of the same application. You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

``

``

Click on the application name on admin to get it up and running.

If you run web2py from source and you have ``python-git`` installed, you can install applications directly from git repository using the ``.git`` URL in the upload form. In this case you will also be used to user the admin interface to push changes back into the repository.

For each application the &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page allows you to:
- Uninstall the application.

``:code

Let&#x27;s analyze this line by line.

Line 1 defines a global variable called ``db`` that represents the database connection. In this case it is a connection to a SQLite database stored in the file  &quot;applications/images/databases/storage.sqlite&quot;. In the SQLite case, if the database does not exist, it is created. You can change the name of the file, as well as the name of the global variable ``db``, but it is convenient to give them the same name, to make it easy to remember.

Lines 3-5 define a table &quot;image&quot;. ``define_table`` is a method of the ``db`` object. The first argument, &quot;image&quot;, is the name of the table we are defining. The other arguments are the fields belonging to that table. This table has a field called &quot;title&quot;, a field called &quot;file&quot;, and a field called &quot;id&quot; that serves as the table primary key (&quot;id&quot; is not explicitly declared because all tables have an id field by default). The field &quot;title&quot; is a string, and the field &quot;file&quot; is of type &quot;upload&quot;. &quot;upload&quot; is a special type of field used by the web2py Data Abstraction Layer (DAL) to store the names of uploaded files. web2py knows how to upload files (via streaming if they are large), rename them safely, and store them.

When a table is defined, web2py takes one of several possible actions:
- if the table does not exist, the table is created;
- if the table exists and does not correspond to the definition, the table is altered accordingly, and if a field has a different type, web2py tries to convert its contents;
- if the table exists and corresponds to the definition, web2py does nothing.

This behavior is called &quot;migration&quot;. In web2py migrations are automatic, but can be disabled for each table by passing ``migrate=False`` as the last argument of ``define_table``.

Line 6 defines a format string for the table. It determines how a record should be represented as a string. Notice that the ``format`` argument can also be a function that takes a record and returns a string. For example:

``
format=lambda row: row.title
response.meta.author = &#x27;you&#x27;
response.meta.description = &#x27;describe your app&#x27;
response.meta.keywords = &#x27;bla bla bla&#x27;
response.menu = [ [ &#x27;Index&#x27;, False, URL(&#x27;index&#x27;) ] ]

### A wiki
``wiki``:inxx ``RSS``:inxx ``Ajax``:inxx ``XMLRPC``:inxx
In this section, we build a wiki, from scratch and without using the extended functionality provided by plugin_wiki which is described in chapter 12. The visitor will be able to create pages, search them (by title), and edit them. The visitor will also be able to post comments (exactly as in the previous applications), and also post documents (as attachments to the pages) and link them from the pages. As a convention, we adopt the Markmin syntax for our wiki syntax. We will also implement a search page with Ajax, an RSS feed for the pages, and a handler to search the pages via XML-RPC``xmlrpc``:cite .

The following diagram lists the actions that we need to implement and the links we intend to build among them.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en3400.png center 250px]]

Start by creating a new scaffolding app, naming it &quot;mywiki&quot;.

The model must contain three tables: page, comment, and document. Both comment and document reference page because they belong to page. A document contains a file field of type upload as in the previous images application.

Here is the complete model:
``
db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)

from gluon.tools import *
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
crud = Crud(db)

``:code

Let&#x27;s analyze this line by line.

Line 1 defines a global variable called ``db`` that represents the database connection. In this case it is a connection to a SQLite database stored in the file  &quot;applications/images/databases/storage.sqlite&quot;. In the SQLite case, if the database does not exist, it is created. You can change the name of the file, as well as the name of the global variable ``db``, but it is convenient to give them the same name, to make it easy to remember.

Lines 3-5 define a table &quot;image&quot;. ``define_table`` is a method of the ``db`` object. The first argument, &quot;image&quot;, is the name of the table we are defining. The other arguments are the fields belonging to that table. This table has a field called &quot;title&quot;, a field called &quot;file&quot;, and a field called &quot;id&quot; that serves as the table primary key (&quot;id&quot; is not explicitly declared because all tables have an id field by default). The field &quot;title&quot; is a string, and the field &quot;file&quot; is of type &quot;upload&quot;. &quot;upload&quot; is a special type of field used by the web2py Data Abstraction Layer (DAL) to store the names of uploaded files. web2py knows how to upload files (via streaming if they are large), rename them safely, and store them.

When a table is defined, web2py takes one of several possible actions:
- if the table does not exist, the table is created;
- if the table exists and does not correspond to the definition, the table is altered accordingly, and if a field has a different type, web2py tries to convert its contents;
- if the table exists and corresponds to the definition, web2py does nothing.

This behavior is called &quot;migration&quot;. In web2py migrations are automatic, but can be disabled for each table by passing ``migrate=False`` as the last argument of ``define_table``.

Line 6 defines a format string for the table. It determines how a record should be represented as a string. Notice that the ``format`` argument can also be a function that takes a record and returns a string. For example:

``
format=lambda row: row.title
response.meta.author = &#x27;you&#x27;
response.meta.description = &#x27;describe your app&#x27;
response.meta.keywords = &#x27;bla bla bla&#x27;
response.menu = [ [ &#x27;Index&#x27;, False, URL(&#x27;index&#x27;) ] ]

### A wiki
``wiki``:inxx ``RSS``:inxx ``Ajax``:inxx ``XMLRPC``:inxx
In this section, we build a wiki, from scratch and without using the extended functionality provided by plugin_wiki which is described in chapter 12. The visitor will be able to create pages, search them (by title), and edit them. The visitor will also be able to post comments (exactly as in the previous applications), and also post documents (as attachments to the pages) and link them from the pages. As a convention, we adopt the Markmin syntax for our wiki syntax. We will also implement a search page with Ajax, an RSS feed for the pages, and a handler to search the pages via XML-RPC``xmlrpc``:cite .

The following diagram lists the actions that we need to implement and the links we intend to build among them.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en3400.png center 250px]]

Start by creating a new scaffolding app, naming it &quot;mywiki&quot;.

The model must contain three tables: page, comment, and document. Both comment and document reference page because they belong to page. A document contains a file field of type upload as in the previous images application.

Here is the complete model:
``
db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)

from gluon.tools import *
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
crud = Crud(db)

db.define_table(&#x27;page&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;title&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, db.auth_user, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, db.page),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, db.auth_user, default=auth.user_id))

db.define_table(&#x27;document&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, db.page),
    Field(&#x27;name&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, db.auth_user, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(name)s&#x27;)

This is implemeneted in the web2py file ``gluon.contrib.autolinks`` and specifically in the function ``expand_one``. You can extend oembed support by registering more services. This is done by appending an entry to the ``EMBED_MAPS`` list:

``
from gluon.contrib.autlinks import EMBED_MAPS
EMBED_MAPS.append((re.compile(&#x27;http://vimeo.com/\S*&#x27;),

#### Referencing wiki content

If you create a wiki page with slug &quot;contactus&quot; you can refer to this page as

``@+////contactus``:code

Here ``@+////`` stands for

``@+/app/controller/function/``:code

but &quot;app&quot;, &quot;controller&quot;, and &quot;function&quot; are omitted thus assuming default.

Similarly you can use the wiki menu to upload a media file (for example an image) linked to the page. The &quot;manage media&quot; page will show all files you have uploaded and will show the proper expression to link the media file. If, for example you upload a file &quot;test.jpg&quot; with title &quot;beach&quot;, the link expression will somthing like:

``@+////15/beach.jpg``:code

``@+////`` is the same prefix described before. ``15`` is the id of the record storing the media file. ``beach`` is the title. ``.jpg`` is the extension of the original file.

If you cut and paste ``@+////15/beach.jpg`` into wiki pages you embed the image.

Mind that media files are linked to pages and inherit access permission from the pages.

#### Wiki menus

If you create a page with slug &quot;wiki-menu&quot; page it will be interpreted as a description of the menu. Here is an example:

``
- Home &gt; @+////index
- Info &gt; @+////info
- web2py &gt; http://google.com
- - About us &gt; @+////aboutus
- - Countact us &gt; @+////contactus

``Mac Mail``:inxx ``Google Maps``:inxx ``jsonp``:inxx
If an extension other than &quot;html&quot; is specified (&quot;json&quot; for example), and the view file &quot;[controller]/[function].json&quot; is not found, web2py looks for the view &quot;generic.json&quot;. web2py comes with generic.html, generic.json, generic.jsonp, generic.xml, generic.rss, generic.ics (for Mac Mail Calendar), generic.map (for embedding Google Mpas), and generic.pdf (based on fpdf). These generic views can be modified for each application individually, and additional views can be added easily.
-------

-------
Generic views are a development tool. In production every action should have its own view. In fact, by default, generic views are only enabled from localhost.
-------

-------
You can also specify a view with ``response.view = &#x27;default/something.html&#x27;``
-------

Read more on this topic in Chapter 10.

If you go back to &quot;EDIT&quot; and click on index, you will now see the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1200.png center 480px]]

For debugging purposes you can always append

``
{{=response.toolbar()}}
``:code

to the code in a view and it will show you some useful information, including the request, response and session objects, and list all db queries with their timing.

### Let&#x27;s count
``session``:inxx
Let&#x27;s now add a counter to this page that will count how many times the same visitor displays the page.

web2py automatically and transparently tracks visitors using sessions and cookies. For each new visitor, it creates a session and assigns a unique &quot;session_id&quot;. The session is a container for variables that are stored server-side. The unique id is sent to the browser via a cookie. When the visitor requests another page from the same application, the browser sends the cookie back, it is retrieved by web2py, and the corresponding session is restored.

is rendered as:
``:code

A handful of helpers (``INPUT``, ``TEXTAREA``, ``OPTION`` and ``SELECT``) also support some special named attributes not starting with underscore (``value``, and ``requires``). They are important for building custom forms and will be discussed later.

Go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. It now indicates that &quot;default.py exposes index&quot;. By clicking on &quot;index&quot;, you can visit the newly created page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/index
``:code

which looks like:

[[image @///image/en2800.png center 480px]]

If you click on the image name link, you are directed to:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/1
``:code

and this results in an error, since you have not yet created an action called &quot;show&quot; in controller &quot;default.py&quot;.

Let&#x27;s edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller and replace its content with:

``SQLFORM``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx ``response.flash``:inxx ``request.args``:inxx
``response.download``:inxx
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
    return dict(images=images)

def show():
    image = db(db.image.id==request.args(0,cast=int)).select().first()
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = SQLFORM(db.comment)
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = &#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)

def download():
    return response.download(request, db)
``:code

The controller contains two actions: &quot;show&quot; and &quot;download&quot;.
The &quot;show&quot; action selects the image with the ``id`` parsed from the request args and all comments related to the image. &quot;show&quot; then passes everything to the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

The image id referenced by:
``
URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id)
``:code

in &quot;default/index.html&quot;, can be accessed as:

``request.args(0,cast=int)``

from the &quot;show&quot; action. The ``cast=int`` argument is optional but very important. It attempts to cast the string value passed in the PATH_INFO into an int. On failure it raise a proper exception instead of causing a ticket. One can also specify a redirect in case of failure to cast:

``request.args(0,cast=int,otherwise=URL(&#x27;error&#x27;))``

The &quot;download&quot; action expects a filename in ``request.args(0)``, builds a path to the location where that file is supposed to be, and sends it back to the client. If the file is too large, it streams the file without incurring any memory overhead.

Notice the following statements:
- Line 7 creates an insert form SQLFORM for the ``db.comment`` table using only the specified fields.
- Line 8 sets the value for the reference field, which is not part of the input form because it is not in the list of fields specified above.
- Line 9 processes the submitted form (the submitted form variables are in ``request.vars``) within the current session (the session is used to prevent double submissions, and to enforce navigation). If the submitted form variables are validated, the new comment is inserted in the ``db.comment`` table; otherwise the form is modified to include error messages (for example, if the author&#x27;s email address is invalid). This is all done in line 9!.
- Line 10 is only executed if the form is accepted, after the record is inserted into the database table. ``response.flash`` is a web2py variable that is displayed in the views and used to notify the visitor that something happened.
- Line 11 selects all comments that reference the current image.

-------
The &quot;download&quot; action is already defined in the &quot;default.py&quot; controller of the scaffolding application.
-------

The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view. The &quot;show&quot; action, though, should have a view, so return to **admin** and create a new view called &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;
     src=&quot;{{=URL(&#x27;download&#x27;, args=image.file)}}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
{{if len(comments):}}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  {{for comment in comments:}}
    &lt;p&gt;{{=comment.author}} says &lt;i&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  {{pass}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{else:}}
When a visitor submits a comment via this page, the comment is stored in the dat

### Adding CRUD

web2py also provides a CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) API that simplifies forms even more. To use CRUD it is necessary to define it somewhere, such as in file &quot;db.py&quot;:
``
from gluon.tools import Crud
crud = Crud(db)
``:code

-------
These two lines are already in the scaffolding application.
-------

The ``crud`` object provides high-level methods, for example:
``
form = crud.create(table)
``:code

that can be used to replace the programming pattern:
``
form = SQLFORM(table)
if form.process().accepted:
    session.flash = &#x27;...&#x27;
    redirect(&#x27;...&#x27;)
``:code

Here, we rewrite the previous &quot;show&quot; action using crud and making some more improvements:

``
def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = crud.create(db.comment,
                       message=&#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;,
		       next=URL(args=image.id))
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)
``:code

First of all notice we have used the syntax

``
db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(...)
``:code

to fetch the required record. Since ```table(id)`` returns None if the record is not found, we can use ``or redirect(...)`` in this case in one line.

The ``next`` argument of ``crud.create`` is the URL to redirect to after the form is accepted. The ``message`` argument is the one to be displayed upon acceptance. You can read more about CRUD in Chapter 7.

### Adding Authentication

The web2py API for Role-Based Access Control is quite sophisticated, but for now we will limit ourselves to restricting access to the show action to authenticated users, deferring a more detailed discussion to Chapter 9.

To limit access to authenticated users, we need to complete three steps. In a model, for example &quot;db.py&quot;, we need to add:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
``:code

In our controller, we need to add one action:
``
def user():
    return dict(form=auth())
``:code

This is sufficient to enable login, register, logout, etc. pages. The default layout will also show options to the corresponding pages in the top right corner.

[[image @///image/en3000.png center 300px]]

We can now decorate the functions that we want to restrict, for example:
``
@auth.requires_login()
def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = crud.create(db.comment, next=URL(args=image.id),
                     message=&#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;)
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)
``:code

Any attempt to access
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/[image_id]
``:code

will require login. If the user is not logged it, the user will be redirected to
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/login
``:code

[[image @///image/en3100.png center 480px]]

The ``user`` function also exposes, among others, the following actions:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/logout
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/register
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/profile
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/change_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/request_reset_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_username
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/verify_email
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/impersonate
db.document.created_on.readable = db.document.created_on.writable = False

Edit the controller &quot;default.py&quot; and create the following actions:
- index: list all wiki pages
- create: post another wiki page
- show: show a wiki page and its comments, and append comments
- edit: edit an existing page
- documents: manage the documents attached to a page
- download: download a document (as in the images example)
- search: display a search box and, via an Ajax callback, return all matching titles as the visitor types
- callback: the Ajax callback function. It returns the HTML that gets embedded in the search page while the visitor types.

    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #F2DEDE;">-------
If an extension other than &quot;html&quot; is specified (&quot;json&quot; for example), and the view file &quot;[controller]/[function].json&quot; is not found, web2py looks for the view &quot;generic.json&quot;. web2py comes with generic.html, generic.json, generic.xml, and generic.rss. These generic views can be modified for each application individually, and additional views can be added easily.
-------

-------
Generic views are a development tool. In production every action should have its own view. In fact, by default, generic views are only enabled from localhost.
-------

-------
You can also specify a view with ``response.view = &#x27;default/something.html&#x27;``
-------

Read more on this topic in Chapter 10.

If you go back to &quot;EDIT&quot; and click on index, you will now see the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1200.png center 480px]]

For debugging purposes you can always append

``
{{=response.toolbar()}}
``:code

to the code in a view and it will show you some useful information, including the request, response and session objects, and list all db queries with their timing.

### Let&#x27;s count
``session``:inxx
Let&#x27;s now add a counter to this page that will count how many times the same visitor displays the page.

web2py automatically and transparently tracks visitors using sessions and cookies. For each new visitor, it creates a session and assigns a unique &quot;session_id&quot;. The session is a container for variables that are stored server-side. The unique id is sent to the browser via a cookie. When the visitor requests another page from the same application, the browser sends the cookie back, it is retrieved by web2py, and the corresponding session is restored.

is rendered as:
``:code

A handful of helpers (``INPUT``, ``TEXTAREA``, ``OPTION`` and ``SELECT``) also support some special named attributes not starting with underscore (``value``, and ``requires``). They are important for building custom forms and will be discussed later.

Go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. It now indicates that &quot;default.py exposes index&quot;. By clicking on &quot;index&quot;, you can visit the newly created page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/index
``:code

which looks like:

[[image @///image/en2800.png center 480px]]

If you click on the image name link, you are directed to:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/1
``:code

and this results in an error, since you have not yet created an action called &quot;show&quot; in controller &quot;default.py&quot;.

Let&#x27;s edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller and replace its content with:

``SQLFORM``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx ``response.flash``:inxx ``request.args``:inxx
``response.download``:inxx
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
    return dict(images=images)

def show():
    image = db(db.image.id==request.args(0)).select().first()
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = SQLFORM(db.comment)
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = &#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)

def download():
    return response.download(request, db)
``:code

The controller contains two actions: &quot;show&quot; and &quot;download&quot;.
The &quot;show&quot; action selects the image with the ``id`` parsed from the request args and all comments related to the image. &quot;show&quot; then passes everything to the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

The image id referenced by:
``
URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id)
``:code

in &quot;default/index.html&quot;, can be accessed as:
``request.args(0)``
from the &quot;show&quot; action.

The &quot;download&quot; action expects a filename in ``request.args(0)``, builds a path to the location where that file is supposed to be, and sends it back to the client. If the file is too large, it streams the file without incurring any memory overhead.

Notice the following statements:
- Line 7 creates an insert form SQLFORM for the ``db.comment`` table using only the specified fields.
- Line 8 sets the value for the reference field, which is not part of the input form because it is not in the list of fields specified above.
- Line 9 processes the submitted form (the submitted form variables are in ``request.vars``) within the current session (the session is used to prevent double submissions, and to enforce navigation). If the submitted form variables are validated, the new comment is inserted in the ``db.comment`` table; otherwise the form is modified to include error messages (for example, if the author&#x27;s email address is invalid). This is all done in line 9!.
- Line 10 is only executed if the form is accepted, after the record is inserted into the database table. ``response.flash`` is a web2py variable that is displayed in the views and used to notify the visitor that something happened.
- Line 11 selects all comments that reference the current image.

-------
The &quot;download&quot; action is already defined in the &quot;default.py&quot; controller of the scaffolding application.
-------

The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view. The &quot;show&quot; action, though, should have a view, so return to **admin** and create a new view called &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;
     src=&quot;{{=URL(&#x27;download&#x27;, args=image.file)}}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
{{if len(comments):}}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  {{for comment in comments:}}
    &lt;p&gt;{{=comment.author}} says &lt;i&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  {{pass}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{else:}}
When a visitor submits a comment via this page, the comment is stored in the dat

### Adding CRUD

web2py also provides a CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) API that simplifies forms even more. To use CRUD it is necessary to define it somewhere, such as in file &quot;db.py&quot;:
``
from gluon.tools import Crud
crud = Crud(db)
``:code

-------
These two lines are already in the scaffolding application.
-------

The ``crud`` object provides high-level methods, for example:
``
form = crud.create(table)
``:code

that can be used to replace the programming pattern:
``
form = SQLFORM(table)
if form.process().accepted:
    session.flash = &#x27;...&#x27;
    redirect(&#x27;...&#x27;)
``:code

Here, we rewrite the previous &quot;show&quot; action using crud and making some more improvements:

``
def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = crud.create(db.comment,
                       message=&#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;,
		       next=URL(args=image.id))
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)
``:code

First of all notice we have used the syntax

``
db.image(request.args(0)) or redirect(...)
``:code

to fetch the required record. Since ```table(id)`` returns None if the record is not found, we can use ``or redirect(...)`` in this case in one line.

The ``next`` argument of ``crud.create`` is the URL to redirect to after the form is accepted. The ``message`` argument is the one to be displayed upon acceptance. You can read more about CRUD in Chapter 7.

### Adding Authentication

The web2py API for Role-Based Access Control is quite sophisticated, but for now we will limit ourselves to restricting access to the show action to authenticated users, deferring a more detailed discussion to Chapter 9.

To limit access to authenticated users, we need to complete three steps. In a model, for example &quot;db.py&quot;, we need to add:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
``:code

In our controller, we need to add one action:
``
def user():
    return dict(form=auth())
``:code

This is sufficient to enable login, register, logout, etc. pages. The default layout will also show options to the corresponding pages in the top right corner.

[[image @///image/en3000.png center 300px]]

We can now decorate the functions that we want to restrict, for example:
``
@auth.requires_login()
def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = crud.create(db.comment, next=URL(args=image.id),
                     message=&#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;)
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)
``:code

Any attempt to access
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/[image_id]
``:code

will require login. If the user is not logged it, the user will be redirected to
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/login
``:code

[[image @///image/en3100.png center 480px]]

The ``user`` function also exposes, among others, the following actions:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/logout
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/register
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/profile
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/change_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/request_reset_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_username
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/verify_email
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/impersonate
db.document.created_on.readable = db.document.created_on.writable = False

Edit the controller &quot;default.py&quot; and create the following actions:
- index: list all wiki pages
- create: post another wiki page
- show: show a wiki page and its comments, and append comments
- edit: edit an existing page
- documents: manage the documents attached to a page
- download: download a document (as in the images example)
- search: display a search box and, via an Ajax callback, return all matching titles as the visitor types
- callback: the Ajax callback function. It returns the HTML that gets embedded in the search page while the visitor types.

Here is the &quot;default.py&quot; controller:
``
def index():
     &quot;&quot;&quot; this controller returns a dictionary rendered by the view
         it lists all wiki pages
     &gt;&gt;&gt; index().has_key(&#x27;pages&#x27;)

### Startup

``Linux``:inxx ``Mac``:inxx ``Windows``:inxx

web2py comes in binary packages for Windows and Mac OS X. They include the Python interpreter so you do not need to have it pre-installed. There is also a source code version that runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and other Unix systems. The Windows and OS X binary versions include the necessary Python interpreter. The source code package assumes that Python is already installed on the computer.

web2py requires no installation. To get started, unzip the downloaded zip file for your specific operating system and execute the corresponding ``web2py`` file.

On Unix and Linux (source distribution), run:
``
python web2py.py
``:code

On OS X (binary distribution), run:
``
open web2py.app
``:code

On Windows (binary web2py distribution), run:
``
web2py.exe
``:code

On Windows (source web2py distribution), run:
``
c:/Python27/python.exe web2py.exe
``:code

------
Attention, to run web2py on Windows from source you must install first Mark Hammond&#x27;s [[Python for Windows extensions http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/]]
------

The web2py program accepts various command line options which are discussed later.

By default, at startup, web2py displays a startup window and then displays a GUI widget that asks you to choose a one-time administrator password, the IP address of the network interface to be used for the web server, and a port number from which to serve requests. By default, web2py runs its web server on 127.0.0.1:8000 (port 8000 on localhost), but you can run it on any available IP address and port. You can query the IP address of your network interface by opening a command line and typing ``ipconfig`` on Windows or ``ifconfig`` on OS X and Linux. From now on we assume web2py is running on localhost (127.0.0.1:8000). Use 0.0.0.0:80 to run web2py publicly on any of your network interfaces.

[[image @///image/en400.png center 306px]]

If you do not provide an administrator password, the administration interface is disabled. This is a security measure to prevent publicly exposing the admin interface.

The administrative interface, **admin**, is only accessible from localhost unless you run web2py behind Apache with mod_proxy. If **admin** detects a proxy, the session cookie is set to secure and **admin** login does not work unless the communication between the client and the proxy goes over HTTPS; this is a security measure. All communications between the client and **admin** must always be local or encrypted; otherwise an attacker would be able to perform a man-in-the middle attack or a replay attack and execute arbitrary code on the server.

After the administration password has been set, web2py starts up the web browser at the page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
``:code

If the computer does not have a default browser, open a web browser and enter the URL.

[[image @///image/en500.png center 480px]]

Clicking on &quot;administrative interface&quot; takes you to the login page for the administration interface.

[[image @///image/en600.png center 480px]]

The administrator password is the password you chose at startup.
Notice that there is only one administrator, and therefore only one administrator password. For security reasons, the developer is asked to choose a new password every time web2py starts unless the &lt;recycle&gt; option is specified. This is distinct from the authentication mechanism in web2py applications.

After the administrator logs into web2py, the browser is redirected to the &quot;site&quot; page.

[[image @///image/en700.png center 480px]]

This page lists all installed web2py applications and allows the administrator to manage them.
web2py comes with three applications:
``admin``:inxx ``examples``:inxx ``welcome``:inxx ``scaffolding``:inxx
- An **admin** application, the one you are using right now.
- An **examples** application, with the online interactive documentation and a replica of the web2py official website.
- A **welcome** application. This is the basic template for any other web2py application. It is referred to as the scaffolding application. This is also the application that welcomes a user at startup.

``appliances``:inxx
Ready-to-use web2py applications are referred to as web2py &#x27;&#x27;appliances&#x27;&#x27;.  You can download many freely available appliances from ``appliances``:cite . web2py users are encouraged to submit new appliances, either in open-source or closed-source (compiled and packed) form.

From the **admin** application&#x27;s &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page, you can perform the following operations:
- **install** an application by completing the form on the bottom right of the page. Give a name to the application, select the file containing a packaged application or the URL where the application is located, and click &quot;submit&quot;.
- **uninstall** an application by clicking the corresponding button. There is a confirmation page.
- **create** a new application by choosing a name and clicking &quot;create&quot;.
- **package** an application for distribution by clicking on the corresponding button. A downloaded application is a tar file containing everything, including the database. You should not untar this file; it is automatically unpackaged by web2py when installed with **admin**.
- **clean up** an application&#x27;s temporary files, such as sessions, errors and cache files.
- **EDIT** an application.

-----
When you create a new application using **admin**, it starts as a clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; scaffolding app with a &quot;models/db.py&quot; that creates a SQLite database, connects to it, instantiates Auth, Crud, and Service, configures them. It also provides a &quot;controller/default.py&quot; which exposes actions &quot;index&quot;, &quot;download&quot;, &quot;user&quot; for user management, and &quot;call&quot; for services. In the following, we assume that these files have been removed; we will be creating apps from scratch.
-----

web2py also comes with a **wizard**, described later in this chapter, that can write an alternate scaffolding code for you based on layouts and plugins available on the web and based on high level description of the models.

### Simple examples

#### Say hello
``index``:inxx

Here, as an example, we create a simple web app that displays the message &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot; to the user. We will call this application &quot;myapp&quot;. We will also add a counter that counts how many times the same user visits the page.

You can create a new application simply by typing its name in the form on the top right of the **site** page in **admin**.

[[image @///image/en800.png center 447px]]

After you press [create], the application is created as a copy of the built-in welcome application.

[[image @///image/en900.png center 480px]]

To run the new application, visit:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp
``:code

Now you have a copy of the welcome application.

To edit an application, click on the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; button for the newly created application.

The **edit** page tells you what is inside the application.
Every web2py application consists of certain files, most of which fall into one of six categories:
- **models**: describe the data representation.
- **controllers**: describe the application logic and workflow.
- **views**: describe the data presentation.
- **languages**: describe how to translate the application presentation to other languages.
- **modules**: Python modules that belong to the application.
- **static files**: static images, CSS  files``css-w,css-o,css-school``:cite , JavaScript files``js-w,js-b``:cite , etc.
- **plugins**: groups of files designed to work together.

Everything is neatly organized following the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Each section in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page corresponds to a subfolder in the application folder.

Notice that section headings will toggle their content. Folder names under static files are also collapsible.

-------
Each file listed in the section corresponds to a file physically located in the subfolder. Any operation performed on a file via the **admin** interface (create, edit, delete) can be performed directly from the shell using your favorite editor.
-------

The application contains other types of files (database, session files, error files, etc.), but they are not listed on the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page because they are not created or modified by the administrator; they are created and modified by the application itself.

The controllers contain the logic and workflow of the application. Every URL gets mapped into a call to one of the functions in the controllers (actions). There are two default controllers: &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and &quot;default.py&quot;. **appadmin** provides the database administrative interface; we do not need it now. &quot;default.py&quot; is the controller that you need to edit, the one that is called by default when no controller is specified in the URL. Edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def index():
    return &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;
``:code

Here is what the online editor looks like:

[[image @///image/en1000.png center 480px]]

Save it and go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. Click on the index link to visit the newly created page.

When you visit the URL
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/default/index
``:code

the index action in the default controller of the myapp application is called. It returns a string that the browser displays for us. It should look like this:

[[image @///image/en1100.png center 480px]]

Now, edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def index():
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;)
``:code

Also from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page, edit the view &quot;default/index.html&quot; (the view file associated with the action) and completely replace the existing contents of that file with the following:
``
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{=message}}&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
``:code

Now the action returns a dictionary defining a ``message``. When an action returns a dictionary, web2py looks for a view with the name

``[controller]/[function].[extension]``:code

 and executes it. Here [extension] is the requested extension. If no extension is specified, it defaults to &quot;html&quot;, and that is what we will assume here. Under this assumption, the view is an HTML file that embeds Python code using special {{ }} tags. In particular, in the example, the ``{{=message}}`` instructs web2py to replace the tagged code with the value of the ``message`` returned by the action. Notice that ``message`` here is not a web2py keyword but is defined in the action. So far we have not used any web2py keywords.

If web2py does not find the requested view, it uses the &quot;generic.html&quot; view that comes with every application.

-------
``Mac Mail``:inxx ``Google Maps``:inxx ``jsonp``:inxx
If an extension other than &quot;html&quot; is specified (&quot;json&quot; for example), and the view file &quot;[controller]/[function].json&quot; is not found, web2py looks for the view &quot;generic.json&quot;. web2py comes with generic.html, generic.json, generic.jsonp, generic.xml, generic.rss, generic.ics (for Mac Mail Calendar), generic.map (for embedding Google Maps), and generic.pdf (based on fpdf). These generic views can be modified for each application individually, and additional views can be added easily.
-------

-------
Generic views are a development tool. In production every action should have its own view. In fact, by default, generic views are only enabled from localhost.
-------

-------
You can also specify a view with ``response.view = &#x27;default/something.html&#x27;``
-------

Read more on this topic in Chapter 10.

If you go back to &quot;EDIT&quot; and click on index, you will now see the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1200.png center 480px]]

For debugging purposes you can always append

``
{{=response.toolbar()}}
``:code

to the code in a view and it will show you some useful information, including the request, response and session objects, and list all db queries with their timing.

#### Let&#x27;s count
``session``:inxx
Let&#x27;s now add a counter to this page that will count how many times the same visitor displays the page.

web2py automatically and transparently tracks visitors using sessions and cookies. For each new visitor, it creates a session and assigns a unique &quot;session_id&quot;. The session is a container for variables that are stored server-side. The unique id is sent to the browser via a cookie. When the visitor requests another page from the same application, the browser sends the cookie back, it is retrieved by web2py, and the corresponding session is restored.

To use the session, modify the default controller:
``
def index():
    if not session.counter:
        session.counter = 1
    else:
        session.counter += 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
``:code

Notice that ``counter`` is not a web2py keyword but ``session`` is. We are asking web2py to check whether there is a counter variable in the session and, if not, to create one and set it to 1. If the counter is there, we ask web2py to increase the counter by 1. Finally we pass the value of the counter to the view.

A more compact way to code the same function is this:
``
def index():
    session.counter = (session.counter or 0) + 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
``:code

Now modify the view to add a line that displays the value of the counter:
``
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{=message}}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Number of visits: {{=counter}}&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
``:code

When you visit the index page again (and again) you should get the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1300.png center 480px]]

The counter is associated with each visitor, and is incremented each time the visitor reloads the page. Different visitors see different counters.


#### Say my name
``form``:inxx ``request.vars``:inxx

Now create two pages (first and second), where the first page creates a form, asks the visitor&#x27;s name, and redirects to the second page, which greets the visitor by name.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1400.png center 200px]]

Write the corresponding actions in the default controller:
``
def first():
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then create a view &quot;default/first.html&quot; for the first action,
and enter:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;form action=&quot;second&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

Finally, create a view &quot;default/second.html&quot; for the second action:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=request.vars.visitor_name}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

``layout``:inxx
In both views we have extended the basic &quot;layout.html&quot; view that comes with web2py. The layout view keeps the look and feel of the two pages coherent. The layout file can be edited and replaced easily, since it mainly contains HTML code.

If you now visit the first page, type your name:

[[image @///image/en1500.png center 480px]]

and submit the form, you will receive a greeting:

[[image @///image/en1600.png center 480px]]

#### Postbacks
``redirect``:inxx ``URL``:inxx ``postback``:inxx

The mechanism for form submission that we used before is very common, but it is not good programming practice. All input should be validated and, in the above example, the burden of validation would fall on the second action. Thus the action that performs the validation is different from the action that generated the form. This tends to cause redundancy in the code.

A better pattern for form submission is to submit forms to the same action that generated them, in our example the &quot;first&quot;. The &quot;first&quot; action should receive the variables, process them, store them server-side, and redirect the visitor to the &quot;second&quot; page, which retrieves the variables. This mechanism is called a &#x27;&#x27;postback&#x27;&#x27;.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1700.png center 200px]]

Modify the default controller to implement self-submission:
``
def first():
    if request.vars.visitor_name:
        session.visitor_name = request.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then modify the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
What is your name?
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

and the &quot;default/second.html&quot; view needs to retrieve the data from the ``session`` instead of from the ``request.vars``:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=session.visitor_name or &quot;anonymous&quot;}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

From the point of view of the visitor, the self-submission behaves exactly the same as the previous implementation. We have not added validation yet, but it is now clear that validation should be performed by the first action.

This approach is better also because the name of the visitor stays in the session, and can be accessed by all actions and views in the applications without having to be passed around explicitly.

Note that if the &quot;second&quot; action is ever called before a visitor name is set, it will display &quot;Hello anonymous&quot; because  ``session.visitor_name`` returns ``None``. Alternatively we could have added the following code in the controller (inside the ``second`` function):

``
if not request.function==&#x27;first&#x27; and not session.visitor_name:
    redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
``:code

This is a general mechanism that you can use to enforce authorization on controllers, though see Chapter 9 for a more powerful method.

``FORM``:inxx ``INPUT``:inxx ``requires``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx

With web2py we can move one step further and ask web2py to generate the form for us, including validation. web2py provides helpers (FORM, INPUT, TEXTAREA, and SELECT/OPTION) with the same names as the equivalent HTML tags. They can be used to build forms either in the controller or in the view.

For example, here is one possible way to rewrite the first action:
``
def first():
    form = FORM(INPUT(_name=&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
              INPUT(_type=&#x27;submit&#x27;))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

where we are saying that the FORM tag contains two INPUT tags. The attributes of the input tags are specified by the named arguments starting with underscore. The ``requires`` argument is not a tag attribute (because it does not start by underscore) but it sets a validator for the value of visitor_name.

Here is yet another better way to create the same form:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;,
                                 label=&#x27;what is yout name?&#x27;,
                                 requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

The ``form`` object can be easily serialized in HTML by embedding it in the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view.
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=form}}
``:code

The ``form.process()`` method applies the validators and returns the form itself. The ``form.accepted`` variable is set to True if the form was processed and passed validation. If the self-submitted form passes validation, it stores the variables in the session and redirects as before. If the form does not pass validation, error messages are inserted into the form and shown to the user, as below:

[[image @///image/en1800.png center 480px]]

In the next section we will show how forms can be generated automatically from a model.

In all or examples we have used the session to pass the user name from the first action to the second. We could have used a different mechanism and pass data as part of a redirect URL:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;,vars=dict(name=name)))
    return dict(form=form)

def second():
    name = request.vars.visitor_name or redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
    return dict(name=name)
``:code

#### Internationalization

You code is likely to include hardcoded strings such as &quot;What is your name?&quot;. You should be able to customize strings without editing the code and in particular insert translations for these strings in different languages. In this wasy if a visitor has the language preference of the browser set to &quot;Italian&quot;, web2py will use the Italian translation for the strings, if available. This feature of web2py is called &quot;internationalization&quot; and it is described in more detail in the next chapter.

Here we just observe that in order to use this feature you should markup strings that need stranslation. This is done by wrapping a a quoted string in code such as

``
&quot;What is your name?&quot;
``:code

with the ``T`` operator:

``
T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)
``:code


You can also mark fo translations strings hardcoded in views. For example

``
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

becomes

``
&lt;h1&gt;{{=T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

It is good practice to do this for every string in the code (field labels, flash messages, etc.) except for tables and field names.

Once the strings are indentified and marked up, web2py takes care of almost evrything else. The admin interface also provides a page where you can translate each string in the languages you desire to support.

### An image blog
``upload``:inxx

Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments.

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;email&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;))

db.image.title.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)
db.comment.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
db.comment.author.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()
db.comment.email.requires = IS_EMAIL()
db.comment.body.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()

db.comment.image_id.writable = db.comment.image_id.readable = False
``:code

Let&#x27;s analyze this line by line.

Line 1 defines a global variable called ``db`` that represents the database connection. In this case it is a connection to a SQLite database stored in the file  &quot;applications/images/databases/storage.sqlite&quot;. In the SQLite case, if the database does not exist, it is created. You can change the name of the file, as well as the name of the global variable ``db``, but it is convenient to give them the same name, to make it easy to remember.

Lines 3-5 define a table &quot;image&quot;. ``define_table`` is a method of the ``db`` object. The first argument, &quot;image&quot;, is the name of the table we are defining. The other arguments are the fields belonging to that table. This table has a field called &quot;title&quot;, a field called &quot;file&quot;, and a field called &quot;id&quot; that serves as the table primary key (&quot;id&quot; is not explicitly declared because all tables have an id field by default). The field &quot;title&quot; is a string, and the field &quot;file&quot; is of type &quot;upload&quot;. &quot;upload&quot; is a special type of field used by the web2py Data Abstraction Layer (DAL) to store the names of uploaded files. web2py knows how to upload files (via streaming if they are large), rename them safely, and store them.

When a table is defined, web2py takes one of several possible actions:
- if the table does not exist, the table is created;
- if the table exists and does not correspond to the definition, the table is altered accordingly, and if a field has a different type, web2py tries to convert its contents;
- if the table exists and corresponds to the definition, web2py does nothing.

This behavior is called &quot;migration&quot;. In web2py migrations are automatic, but can be disabled for each table by passing ``migrate=False`` as the last argument of ``define_table``.

Line 6 defines a format string for the table. It determines how a record should be represented as a string. Notice that the ``format`` argument can also be a function that takes a record and returns a string. For example:

``
format=lambda row: row.title
``:code

Lines 8-12 define another table called &quot;comment&quot;.
A comment has an &quot;author&quot;, an &quot;email&quot; (we intend to store the email address of the author of the comment), a &quot;body&quot; of type &quot;text&quot; (we intend to use it to store the actual comment posted by the author), and an &quot;image_id&quot; field of type reference that points to ``db.image`` via the &quot;id&quot; field.

In line 14, ``db.image.title`` represents the field &quot;title&quot; of table &quot;image&quot;. The attribute ``requires`` allows you to set requirements/constraints that will be enforced by web2py forms. Here we require that the &quot;title&quot; is unique:

``IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)``:code

&#x27;&#x27;Notice this is optional because it is set automatically given that ``Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True)``&#x27;&#x27;.

The objects representing these constraints are called validators. Multiple validators can be grouped in a list. Validators are executed in the order they appear.
``IS_NOT_IN_DB(a, b)`` is a special validator that checks that the value of a field ``b`` for a new record is not already in ``a``.

Line 15 requires that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;comment&quot; is in ``db.image.id``. As far as the database is concerned, we had already declared this  when we defined the table &quot;comment&quot;.
Now we are explicitly telling the model that this condition should be enforced by web2py, too, at the form processing level when a new comment is posted, so that invalid values do not propagate from input forms to the database. We also require that the &quot;image_id&quot; be represented by the &quot;title&quot;, ``&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;``, of the corresponding record.

Line 20 indicates that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;comment&quot; should not be shown in forms, ``writable=False`` and not even in readonly forms, ``readable=False``.

The meaning of the validators in lines 15-17 should be obvious.

``format``:inxx
Notice that the validator
``
db.comment.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

can be omitted (and would be automatic) if we specify a format for referenced table:
``
db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;, ..., format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

where the format can be a string or a function that takes a record and returns a string.

``appadmin``:inxx
Once a model is defined, if there are no errors, web2py creates an application administration interface to manage the database. You access it via the &quot;database administration&quot; link in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page or directly:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/appadmin
``:code

Here is a screenshot of the **appadmin** interface:

[[image @///image/en2100.png center 480px]]

This interface is coded in the controller called &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and the corresponding view &quot;appadmin.html&quot;. From now on, we will refer to this interface simply as **appadmin**. It allows the administrator to insert new database records, edit and delete existing records, browse tables, and perform database joins.

The first time **appadmin** is accessed, the model is executed and the tables are created. The web2py DAL translates Python code into SQL statements that are specific to the selected database back-end (SQLite in this example). You can see the generated SQL from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page by clicking on the &quot;sql.log&quot; link under &quot;models&quot;. Notice that the link is not present until the tables have been created.

[[image @///image/en2200.png center 480px]]

If you were to edit the model and access **appadmin** again, web2py would generate SQL to alter the existing tables. The generated SQL is logged into &quot;sql.log&quot;.

Now go back to **appadmin** and try to insert a new image record:

[[image @///image/en2300.png center 480px]]

web2py has translated the ``db.image.file`` &quot;upload&quot; field into an upload form for the file. When the form is submitted and an image file is uploaded, the file is renamed in a secure way that preserves the extension, it is saved with the new name under the application &quot;uploads&quot; folder, and the new name is stored in the ``db.image.file`` field. This process is designed to prevent directory traversal attacks.

Notice that each field type is rendered by a &#x27;&#x27;widget&#x27;&#x27;. Default widgets can be overridden.

When you click on a table name in **appadmin**, web2py performs a select of all records on the current table, identified by the DAL query
``
db.image.id &gt; 0
``:code

and renders the result.

[[image @///image/en2400.png center 480px]]

You can select a different set of records by editing the SQL query and pressing [Submit].

To edit or delete a single record, click on the record id number.

Because of the ``IS_IN_DB`` validator, the reference field &quot;image_id&quot; is rendered by a drop-down menu. The items in the drop-down are stored as keys (``db.image.id``), but are represented by their ``db.image.title``, as specified by the validator.

Validators are powerful objects that know how to represent fields, filter field values, generate errors, and format values extracted from the field.

The following figure shows what happens when you submit a form that does not pass validation:

[[image @///image/en2500.png center 480px]]

The same forms that are automatically generated by **appadmin** can also be generated programmatically via the ``SQLFORM`` helper and embedded in user applications. These forms are CSS-friendly, and can be customized.

Every application has its own **appadmin**; therefore, **appadmin** itself can be modified without affecting other applications.

So far, the application knows how to store data, and we have seen how to access the database via **appadmin**. Access to **appadmin** is restricted to the administrator, and it is not intended as a production web interface for the application; hence the next part of this walk-through. Specifically we want to create:
- An &quot;index&quot; page that lists all available images sorted by title and links to detail pages for the images.
- A &quot;show/[id]&quot; page that shows the visitor the requested image and allows the visitor to view and post comments.
- A &quot;download/[name]&quot; action to download uploaded images.

This is represented schematically here:

[[yUML diagram @///image/en2600.png center 480px]]

Go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page and edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller, replacing its contents with the following:

``select``:inxx
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
    return dict(images=images)
``:code

This action returns a dictionary. The keys of the items in the dictionary are interpreted as variables passed to the view associated to the action. When developing, if there is no view, the action is rendered by the &quot;generic.html&quot; view that is provided with every web2py application.

The index action performs a select of all fields (``db.image.ALL``) from table image, ordered by ``db.image.title``. The result of the select is a ``Rows`` object containing the records. Assign it to a local variable called ``images`` returned by the action to the view. ``images`` is iterable and its elements are the selected rows. For each row the columns can be accessed as dictionaries:
``images[0][&#x27;title&#x27;]`` or equivalently as ``images[0].title``.

If you do not write a view, the dictionary is rendered by &quot;views/generic.html&quot; and a call to the index action would look like this:

[[image @///image/en2700.png center 480px]]

You have not created a view for this action yet, so web2py renders the set of records in plain tabular form.

Proceed to create a view for the index action. Return to admin, edit &quot;default/index.html&quot; and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Current Images&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{{for image in images:}}
{{=LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&quot;show&quot;, args=image.id)))}}
{{pass}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

The first thing to notice is that a view is pure HTML with special {{...}} tags. The code embedded in {{...}} is pure Python code with one caveat: indentation is irrelevant. Blocks of code start with lines ending in colon (:) and end in lines beginning with the keyword ``pass``. In some cases the end of a block is obvious from context and the use of ``pass`` is not required.

Lines 5-7 loop over the image rows and for each row image display:
``
LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id))
``:code

This is a ``&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;`` tag that contains an ``&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;`` tag which contains the ``image.title``. The value of the hypertext reference (href attribute) is:
``
URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id)
``:code

i.e., the URL within the same application and controller as the current request that calls the function called &quot;show&quot;, passing a single argument to the function, ``args=image.id``.
``LI``, ``A``, etc. are web2py helpers that map to the corresponding HTML tags. Their unnamed arguments are interpreted as objects to be serialized and inserted in the tag&#x27;s innerHTML. Named arguments starting with an underscore (for example ``_href``) are interpreted as tag attributes but without the underscore. For example ``_href`` is the ``href`` attribute, ``_class`` is the ``class`` attribute, etc.

As an example, the following statement:
``
{{=LI(A(&#x27;something&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=123))}}
``:code

is rendered as:
``
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/default/show/123&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
``:code

A handful of helpers (``INPUT``, ``TEXTAREA``, ``OPTION`` and ``SELECT``) also support some special named attributes not starting with underscore (``value``, and ``requires``). They are important for building custom forms and will be discussed later.

Go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. It now indicates that &quot;default.py exposes index&quot;. By clicking on &quot;index&quot;, you can visit the newly created page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/index
``:code

which looks like:

[[image @///image/en2800.png center 480px]]

If you click on the image name link, you are directed to:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/1
``:code

and this results in an error, since you have not yet created an action called &quot;show&quot; in controller &quot;default.py&quot;.

Let&#x27;s edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller and replace its content with:

``SQLFORM``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx ``response.flash``:inxx ``request.args``:inxx
``response.download``:inxx
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
    return dict(images=images)

def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = SQLFORM(db.comment)
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = &#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)

def download():
    return response.download(request, db)
``:code

The controller contains two actions: &quot;show&quot; and &quot;download&quot;.
The &quot;show&quot; action selects the image with the ``id`` parsed from the request args and all comments related to the image. &quot;show&quot; then passes everything to the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

The image id referenced by:
``
URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id)
``:code

in &quot;default/index.html&quot;, can be accessed as:

``request.args(0,cast=int)``

from the &quot;show&quot; action. The ``cast=int`` argument is optional but very important. It attempts to cast the string value passed in the PATH_INFO into an int. On failure it raise a proper exception instead of causing a ticket. One can also specify a redirect in case of failure to cast:

``request.args(0,cast=int,otherwise=URL(&#x27;error&#x27;))``

Moreover ``db.image(...)`` is a shortcut for

``
db(db.image.id==...).select().first()
``:code

The &quot;download&quot; action expects a filename in ``request.args(0)``, builds a path to the location where that file is supposed to be, and sends it back to the client. If the file is too large, it streams the file without incurring any memory overhead.

Notice the following statements:
- Line 7 creates an insert form SQLFORM for the ``db.comment`` table using only the specified fields.
- Line 8 sets the value for the reference field, which is not part of the input form because it is not in the list of fields specified above.
- Line 9 processes the submitted form (the submitted form variables are in ``request.vars``) within the current session (the session is used to prevent double submissions, and to enforce navigation). If the submitted form variables are validated, the new comment is inserted in the ``db.comment`` table; otherwise the form is modified to include error messages (for example, if the author&#x27;s email address is invalid). This is all done in line 9!.
- Line 10 is only executed if the form is accepted, after the record is inserted into the database table. ``response.flash`` is a web2py variable that is displayed in the views and used to notify the visitor that something happened.
- Line 11 selects all comments that reference the current image.

-------
The &quot;download&quot; action is already defined in the &quot;default.py&quot; controller of the scaffolding application.
-------

The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view. The &quot;show&quot; action, though, should have a view, so return to **admin** and create a new view called &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;
     src=&quot;{{=URL(&#x27;download&#x27;, args=image.file)}}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
{{if len(comments):}}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  {{for comment in comments:}}
    &lt;p&gt;{{=comment.author}} says &lt;i&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  {{pass}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{else:}}
  &lt;h2&gt;No comments posted yet&lt;/h2&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

This view displays the **image.file** by calling the &quot;download&quot; action inside an ``&lt;img ... /&gt;`` tag.
If there are comments, it loops over them and displays each one.

Here is how everything will appear to a visitor.

[[image @///image/en2900.png center 480px]]

When a visitor submits a comment via this page, the comment is stored in the database and appended at the bottom of the page.

#### Adding authentication

The web2py API for Role-Based Access Control is quite sophisticated, but for now we will limit ourselves to restricting access to the show action to authenticated users, deferring a more detailed discussion to Chapter 9.

To limit access to authenticated users, we need to complete three steps. In a model, for example &quot;db.py&quot;, we need to add:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables(username=True)
``:code

In our controller, we need to add one action:
``
def user():
    return dict(form=auth())
``:code

This is sufficient to enable login, register, logout, etc. pages. The default layout will also show options to the corresponding pages in the top right corner.

[[image @///image/en3000.png center 300px]]

We can now decorate the functions that we want to restrict, for example:
``
@auth.requires_login()
def show():
    ...
``:code

Any attempt to access
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/[image_id]
``:code

will require login. If the user is not logged it, the user will be redirected to
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/login
``:code

[[image @///image/en3100.png center 480px]]

The ``user`` function also exposes, among others, the following actions:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/logout
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/register
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/profile
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/change_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/request_reset_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_username
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/verify_email
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/impersonate
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/not_authorized
``:code

Now, a first-time user needs to register in order to be able to log in and read or post comments.

-------
Both the ``auth`` object and the ``user`` function are already defined in the scaffolding application. The ``auth`` object is highly customizable and can deal with email verification, registration approvals, CAPTCHA, and alternate login methods via plugins.
-------

#### Adding grids

We can improve this further using the ``SQLFORM.grid`` and ``SQLFORM.smartgrid`` gadgets to create a management interface for our application:

``
@auth.requires_membership(&#x27;manager&#x27;)
def manage():
    grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.image,linked_tables=[&#x27;comment&#x27;])
    return dict(grid=grid)
``:code

with associated &quot;views/default/manage.html&quot;

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;Management Interface&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``

Using appadmin create a group &quot;manager&quot; and make some users members of the group. They will not be able to access

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/manage
``

and browse, search:

[[image @///image/en3200.png center 480px]]

create, update and delete images and their comments:

[[image @///image/en3300.png center 480px]]

#### Configuring the layout

You can configure the default layout by editing &quot;views/layout.html&quot; but you can also configure it without editing the HTML. In fact, the &quot;static/base.css&quot; stylesheet is well documented and described in Chapter 5. You can change color, columns, size, borders and background without editing the HTML. If you want to edit the menu, the title or the subtitle, you can do so in any model file. The scaffolding app, sets default values of these parameters in the file &quot;models/menu.py&quot;:

``
response.title = request.application
response.subtitle = &#x27;customize me!&#x27;
response.meta.author = &#x27;you&#x27;
response.meta.description = &#x27;describe your app&#x27;
response.meta.keywords = &#x27;bla bla bla&#x27;
response.menu = [ [ &#x27;Index&#x27;, False, URL(&#x27;index&#x27;) ] ]
``:code

### A simple wiki
``wiki``:inxx ``RSS``:inxx ``Ajax``:inxx ``XMLRPC``:inxx

In this section, we build a simple wiki from scratch using only low level APIs (as opposed to using the built-in wiki capabilities of web2py demonstrated in the next section). The visitor will be able to create pages, search them (by title), and edit them. The visitor will also be able to post comments (exactly as in the previous applications), and also post documents (as attachments to the pages) and link them from the pages. As a convention, we adopt the Markmin syntax for our wiki syntax. We will also implement a search page with Ajax, an RSS feed for the pages, and a handler to search the pages via XML-RPC``xmlrpc``:cite . The following diagram lists the actions that we need to implement and the links we intend to build among them.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en3400.png center 200px]]

Start by creating a new scaffolding app, naming it &quot;mywiki&quot;.

The model must contain three tables: page, comment, and document. Both comment and document reference page because they belong to page. A document contains a file field of type upload as in the previous images application.

Here is the complete model:
``
db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)

from gluon.tools import *
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
crud = Crud(db)

db.define_table(&#x27;page&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;title&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id))

db.define_table(&#x27;document&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;name&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(name)s&#x27;)

db.page.title.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, &#x27;page.title&#x27;)
db.page.body.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()
db.page.created_by.readable = db.page.created_by.writable = False
db.page.created_on.readable = db.page.created_on.writable = False

db.comment.body.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()

db.comment.created_by.readable = db.comment.created_by.writable = False
db.comment.created_on.readable = db.comment.created_on.writable = False

db.document.name.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, &#x27;document.name&#x27;)
db.document.page_id.readable = db.document.page_id.writable = False
db.document.created_by.readable = db.document.created_by.writable = False
db.document.created_on.readable = db.document.created_on.writable = False
``:code

Edit the controller &quot;default.py&quot; and create the following actions:
- index: list all wiki pages
- create: post another wiki page
- show: show a wiki page and its comments, and append comments
- edit: edit an existing page
- documents: manage the documents attached to a page
- download: download a document (as in the images example)
- search: display a search box and, via an Ajax callback, return all matching titles as the visitor types
- callback: the Ajax callback function. It returns the HTML that gets embedded in the search page while the visitor types.

Here is the &quot;default.py&quot; controller:
``
def index():
     &quot;&quot;&quot; this controller returns a dictionary rendered by the view
         it lists all wiki pages
     &gt;&gt;&gt; index().has_key(&#x27;pages&#x27;)
     True
     &quot;&quot;&quot;
     pages = db().select(db.page.id,db.page.title,orderby=db.page.title)
     return dict(pages=pages)

@auth.requires_login()
def create():
     &quot;creates a new empty wiki page&quot;
     form = SQLFORM(db.page).process(next=URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
     return dict(form=form)

def show():
     &quot;shows a wiki page&quot;
     this_page = db.page(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
     db.comment.page_id.default = this_page.id
     form = SQLFORM(db.comment).process() if auth.user else None
     pagecomments = db(db.comment.page_id==this_page.id).select()
     return dict(page=this_page, comments=pagecomments, form=form)

@auth.requires_login()
def edit():
     &quot;edit an existing wiki page&quot;
     this_page = db.page(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
     form = SQLFORM(db.page, this_page).process(
         next = URL(&#x27;show&#x27;,args=request.args))
     return dict(form=form)

@auth.requires_login()
def documents():
     &quot;browser, edit all documents attached to a certain page&quot;
     page = db.page(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
     db.document.page_id.default = page.id
     db.document.page_id.writable = False
     grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.document.page_id==page.id,args=[page.id])

     &quot;an ajax wiki search page&quot;
     return dict(form=FORM(INPUT(_id=&#x27;keyword&#x27;,_name=&#x27;keyword&#x27;,
              _onkeyup=&quot;ajax(&#x27;callback&#x27;, [&#x27;keyword&#x27;], &#x27;target&#x27;);&quot;)),
              target_div=DIV(_id=&#x27;target&#x27;))

def callback():
     &quot;an ajax callback that returns a &lt;ul&gt; of links to wiki pages&quot;
     query = db.page.title.contains(request.vars.keyword)
     pages = db(query).select(orderby=db.page.title)
     links = [A(p.title, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;,args=p.id)) for p in pages]
     return UL(*links)
``:code


Lines 2-6 provide a comment for the index action. Lines 4-5 inside the comment are interpreted by python as test code (doctest). Tests can be run via the admin interface. In this case the tests verify that the index action runs without errors.

Lines 18, 27, and 35 try to fetch a ``page`` record with the id in
``request.args(0)``.

Lines 13, 20 define and process create forms for a new page and a new comment and.

Line 28 defines and processes an update form for a wiki page.

Line 38 creates a ``grid`` object that allows to browser, add and update the comments linked to a page.

Some magic happens in line 51. The ``onkeyup`` attribute of the INPUT tag &quot;keyword&quot; is set. Every time the visitor releases a key, the JavaScript code inside the ``onkeyup`` attribute is executed, client-side. Here is the JavaScript code:
``
ajax(&#x27;callback&#x27;, [&#x27;keyword&#x27;], &#x27;target&#x27;);
``:code
``ajax`` is a JavaScript function defined in the file &quot;web2py.js&quot; which is included by the default &quot;layout.html&quot;. It takes three parameters: the URL of the action that performs the synchronous callback, a list of the IDs of variables to be sent to the callback ([&quot;keyword&quot;]), and the ID where the response has to be inserted (&quot;target&quot;).

As soon as you type something in the search box and release a key, the client calls the server and sends the content of the &#x27;keyword&#x27; field, and, when the sever responds, the response is embedded in the page itself as the innerHTML of the &#x27;target&#x27; tag.

The &#x27;target&#x27; tag is a DIV defined in line 52. It could have been defined in the view as well.

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/create.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Create new wiki page&lt;/h1&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

If you visit the **create** page, you see the following:

[[image @///image/en3500.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/index.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Available wiki pages&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;search&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;search&#x27;))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;{{for page in pages:}}
     {{=LI(A(page.title, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=page.id)))}}
{{pass}}&lt;/ul&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;create page&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;create&#x27;))}} ]
``:code

It generates the following page:

[[image @///image/en3600.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;:

``markdown``:inxx ``MARKMIN``:inxx
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;{{=page.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;edit&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;edit&#x27;, args=request.args))}}
| {{=A(&#x27;documents&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;documents&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
{{for comment in comments:}}
  &lt;p&gt;{{=db.auth_user[comment.created_by].first_name}} on {{=comment.created_on}}
          says &lt;I&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

If you wish to use markdown syntax instead of markmin syntax:

``
from gluon.contrib.markdown import WIKI
``:code

and use ``WIKI`` instead of the ``MARKMIN`` helper.
Alternatively, you can choose to accept raw HTML instead of markmin syntax. In this case you would replace:
``
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
``:code

with:
``
{{=XML(page.body)}}
``:code

``sanitize``:inxx
(so that the XML does not get escaped, as by default web2py behavior).

This can be done better with:
``
{{=XML(page.body, sanitize=True)}}
``:code

By setting ``sanitize=True``, you tell web2py to escape unsafe XML tags such as &quot;&lt;script&gt;&quot;, and thus prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Now if, from the index page, you click on a page title, you can see the page that you have created:

[[image @///image/en3700.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/edit.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Edit wiki page&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;show&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

It generates a page that looks almost identical to the create page.

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/documents.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Documents for page: {{=page.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;show&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documents&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``:code

If, from the &quot;show&quot; page, you click on documents, you can now manage the documents attached to the page.

[[image @///image/en3800.png center 480px]]

Finally here is the code for the view &quot;default/search.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Search wiki pages&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;listall&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))}}]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=form}}&lt;br /&gt;{{=target_div}}
``:code

which generates the following Ajax search form:

[[image @///image/en3900.png center 480px]]

You can also try to call the callback action directly by visiting, for example, the following URL:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/callback?keyword=wiki
``:code

If you look at the page source you see the HTML returned by the callback:
``
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mywiki/default/show/4&quot;&gt;I made a Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

``rss``:inxx
Generating an RSS feed from the stored pages using web2py is easy because web2py includes ``gluon.contrib.rss2``. Just append the following action to the default controller:
``
def news():
    &quot;generates rss feed form the wiki pages&quot;
    reponse.generic_patterns = [&#x27;.rss&#x27;]
    pages = db().select(db.page.ALL, orderby=db.page.title)
    return dict(
       title = &#x27;mywiki rss feed&#x27;,
       link = &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/index&#x27;,
       description = &#x27;mywiki news&#x27;,
       created_on = request.now,
       items = [
          dict(title = row.title,
               link = URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=row.id),
               description = MARKMIN(row.body).xml(),
               created_on = row.created_on
               ) for row in pages])
``:code

and when you visit the page
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/news.rss
``:code

you see the feed (the exact output depends on the feed reader). Notice that the dict is automatically converted to RSS, thanks to the .rss extension in the URL.

[[image @///image/en4000.png center 480px]]

web2py also includes feedparser to read third-party feeds.

``XMLRPC``:inxx
Finally, let&#x27;s add an XML-RPC handler that allows searching the wiki programmatically:
``
service = Service()

@service.xmlrpc
def find_by(keyword):
     &quot;finds pages that contain keyword for XML-RPC&quot;
     return db(db.page.title.contains(keyword)).select().as_list()

def call():
    &quot;exposes all registered services, including XML-RPC&quot;
    return service()
``:code

Here, the handler action simply publishes (via XML-RPC), the functions specified in the list. In this case, ``find_by``. ``find_by`` is not an action (because it takes an argument). It queries the database with ``.select()`` and then extracts the records as a list with ``.response`` and returns the list.

Here is an example of how to access the XML-RPC handler from an external
Python program.
``
&gt;&gt;&gt; import xmlrpclib
&gt;&gt;&gt; server = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(
    &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/call/xmlrpc&#x27;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in server.find_by(&#x27;wiki&#x27;):
        print item[&#x27;created_on&#x27;], item[&#x27;title&#x27;]
``:code

The handler can be accessed from many other programming languages that understand XML-RPC, including C, C++, C# and Java.

#### On ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time`` format

There are three different representation for each of the field types ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time``:
- the database representation
- the internal web2py prepresentation
- the string representation in forms and tables

The database representation is an internal issue and does not affect the code. Internally, at the web2py level, they are stored as ``datetime.date``, ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.time`` object respectively and they can be manipulated as such:

``
for page in db(db.page).select():
    print page.title, page.day, page.month, page.year
``

When dates are converted to strings in forms they are converted using the ISO representation
``
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
``

yet this representation in internationalized and you can use the admin stranslation page to change the format to an alternate one. For example:

``
%m/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S
``

Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications is already written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need declare that the application current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide and example of the built-in web2py wiki.

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

------
Notice the API of the built-in wiki are still considered experimental and small changes are still possible.
------

Here we assume we are starting from cratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is understood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You man make your own view for this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. There is no need to call the action &quot;index&quot;.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have RULS like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_create
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_search
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_could
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_recent
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_edit/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_editmedia/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_preview/...
``

Try create more pages such as &quot;index&quot;, &quot;aboutus&quot;, and &quot;contactus&quot;.
Try edit them.


The ``wiki`` method has the following signature:

``
def wiki(self, slug=None, env=None, render=&#x27;markmin&#x27;,
         manage_permissions=False, force_prefix=&#x27;&#x27;,
         restrict_search=False, resolve=True,
         extra=None, menugroups=None)
``:code

It takes the following arguments:

- ``render`` which defaults to ``&#x27;markmin&#x27;`` but can be set equal to ``&#x27;html&#x27;``. It termines the syntax of the wiki. We will discuss the makrmin wiki markup later. If you change it to HTML you may want to use a wysiwyg javascript editor such as TinyMCE of NicEdit.
- ``manage_permissions``. This is set to ``False`` by default and only recognizes permissions for &quot;wiki-editor&quot; and &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you change it to ``True`` the create/edit page will give the option to specify by names the groups whose members have permssion to read and edit the page. In this case is a group &quot;everybody&quot; to give read permission to everybody.
- ``force_prefix``. If set to something like ``&#x27;%(id)s-&#x27;`` it will restict authors (not editors) to create page with a prefix like &quot;[user id]-[page name]&quot;. The prefix can contain the id (&quot;%(id)s&quot;) or the username (&quot;%(username)s&quot;) or any other field from the auth_user table, as long as the corresponding column contains valid string that would pass URL validation.
- ``restrict_search``. This default to ``False`` and any logged-in user can search all wiki pages (but not necessary read or edit them). If set to ``True``, authors can search only their own pages, editors can search everything, other users cannot search anything.
- ``menugroups``. This defaults to ``None`` and it indictates that wiki management menu (search, create, edit, etc.) is always displayed. You can set it to a list of group names whose members only can see this menu, for exmaple ``[&#x27;wiki-editor&#x27;,&#x27;wiki-author&#x27;]``. Notice that even if the menu is exposed to everybody does not mean everybody is allowed to perform actions listed in the menu since they are regulated by the access control system.

The ``wiki`` method has some additional parameters which will be explained later: ``slug``, ``env``, and ``extra``.



#### MARKMIN basics

The MARKMIN syntax allows you to markup **bold** text using ``**bold**``, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27; text with ``&#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;``, ``code`` text with ``\`\`code\`\```. Titles must be prefixed by a #, sections by ##, and sub-sections by ###. Use a minus(-) to prefix an un-ordered item and plus(+) to prefix an ordered item. URLs are automatically into links. For example:

``
# This is title
## this is a section title
### this is a subsection title

Text can be **bold**, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;, !`!!`!code!`!!`! etc.
Learn more at:

http://web2py.com
``:code


You can use the ``extra`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to pass extra rendering rules to the MARKMIN helper.

You can find more information about the MARKMIN syntax in chapter 5.

``auth.wiki`` is more powerful than the barebone MARKMIN helpers. In fact it supports oembed and components.

You can use theS ``env`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to expose functions to your wiki.
For example:

``
auth.wiki(env=dict(join=lambda a,b,c:&quot;%s-%s-%s&quot; % (a,b,c)))
``

allows you to use the markup syntax:

``
@(join:1,2,3)
``


This call the join function passed as extra with parameters ``a,b,c=1,2,3`` and will be redered as ``1-2-3``.

#### Oembed protocol

You can type in (or cut-and-paste) any URL into a wiki page it normally is rendered as a link to the URL. There are exceptions:

- If the URL has an image extension, the link is embedded as an image, ``&lt;img/&gt;``.
- If the URL has an audio extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 audio ``&lt;audio/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a video extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 video ``&lt;video/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a MS Office or PDF extension, Google Doc Viewer is embedded, showing the content of the document (only works for public documents).
- If the URL points to a Youtube page, a Viemo page, or a Flickr page, web2py contacts the corrsponding web service and queries it about the propor way to embed the contect. This is done using the ``oembed`` protocol.

Here is a complete list of supported formats:
``
Image (.PNG, .GIF, .JPG, .JPEG)
Audio (.WAV, .OGG, .MP3)
Video (.MOV, .MPE, .MP4, .MPG, .MPG2, .MPEG, .MPEG4, .MOVIE)
``

Supported via Google Doc Viewer:

``
Microsoft Excel (.XLS and .XLSX)
Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 / 2010 (.PPTX)
Apple Pages (.PAGES)
Adobe PDF (.PDF)
Adobe Illustrator (.AI)
Adobe Photoshop (.PSD)
Autodesk AutoCad (.DXF)
Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG)
PostScript (.EPS, .PS)
TrueType (.TTF)
xml Paper Specification (.XPS)
``:code

Supported by oembed:

``
flickr.com
youtube.com
hulu.com
vimeo.com
slideshare.net
qik.com
polleverywhere.com
wordpress.com
revision3.com
viddler.com
``:code

This is implemeneted in the web2py file ``gluon.contrib.autolinks`` and specifically in the function ``expand_one``. You can extend oembed support by registering more services. This is done by appending an entry to the ``EMBED_MAPS`` list:

``
from gluon.contrib.autlinks import EMBED_MAPS
EMBED_MAPS.append((re.compile(&#x27;http://vimeo.com/\S*&#x27;),
                   &#x27;http://vimeo.com/api/oembed.json&#x27;))
``:code

#### Referencing wiki content

If you create a wiki page with slug &quot;contactus&quot; you can refer to this page as

``\@////contactus``:code

Here ``\@////`` stands for

``\@/app/controller/function/``:code

but &quot;app&quot;, &quot;controller&quot;, and &quot;function&quot; are omitted thus assuming default.

Similarly you can use the wiki menu to upload a media file (for example an image) linked to the page. The &quot;manage media&quot; page will show all files you have uploaded and will show the proper expression to link the media file. If, for example you upload a file &quot;test.jpg&quot; with title &quot;beach&quot;, the link expression will somthing like:

``\@////15/beach.jpg``:code

``\@////`` is the same prefix described before. ``15`` is the id of the record storing the media file. ``beach`` is the title. ``.jpg`` is the extension of the original file.

If you cut and paste ``\@////15/beach.jpg`` into wiki pages you embed the image.

Mind that media files are linked to pages and inherit access permission from the pages.

#### Wiki menus

If you create a page with slug &quot;wiki-menu&quot; page it will be interpreted as a description of the menu. Here is an example:

``
- Home &gt; \@////index
- Info &gt; \@////info
- web2py &gt; http://google.com
- - About us &gt; \@////aboutus
- - Countact us &gt; \@////contactus
``

Each line a menu item. We used double dash for nested menu ites. The ``&gt;`` symbols separates the menu item title from the menu item link.

Mind that the menu is appended to ``response.menu``. It does not replace it. The ``[wiki]`` menu tem with service functions is added automatically.

#### Service functions

If, for example, you want to use the wiki to create an editable sidebar you could create a page with ``slug=&quot;sidebar&quot;`` and then embed it in your layout.html with

``
{{=auth.wiki(slug=&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)}}
``:code

Notice that there is nothing special with the word &quot;sidebar&quot;. Any wiki page can be retrieved and emebdded in any point in your code. This allows you mix and match wiki functionalities with regular web2py functionalities.

You can also embed special wiki functions as the search by tags:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_search&#x27;)}}
``:code

or the tag cloud:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_cloud&#x27;)}}
``:code

#### Components

One of the most powerful function of the new web2py consists in the ability of embedding an action inside another action. We call this a component.

Consider the following model:

``
db.define_table(&#x27;thing&#x27;,Field(&#x27;name&#x27;,requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
``:code

and the following action:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage_things():
    return SQLFORM.grid(db.thing)
``:code

This action is special because it returns a widget/helper not a dict of objects. Now we can embed this ``manage_things`` action into any view, with

``
{{=LOAD(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;manage_things&#x27;,ajax=True)}}
``:code

This allows the visitor interact with the component via Ajax without reloadin the host page that embeds the widget. Basically the action is called via Ajax, inherits the stile of the host page, and capture all forms submissions and flash messages so that thye are handled within the current page. On top of this the ``SQLFORM.grid`` widget uses digitally signed URLs to restrict access. More informaiton about components can be found in chapter 13.

Components like the one above can be embedded into wiki pages using the MARKMIN syntax:

``
@{component:default/manage_things}
``

This simply tells web2py that we want to incude the &quot;manage_things&quot; action defined in the &quot;default&quot; controller as an Ajax &quot;component&quot;.

---------
Most users will be able to build relatively complex applications simply by using ``auth.wiki`` to create pages and menus, and embedded custom components into wiki pages. Wiki can be tough as a mechanism to allow members of the group to create pages but they calso be though as a way to develop applications in a modular way.
---------

### More on **admin**
``admin``:inxx

The administrative interface provides additional functionality that we briefly review here.

#### Site
``site``:inxx

This page lists all installed applications. There are two forms at the bottom.

The first of them allows creating a new application by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The second form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it. This can be its original name, but does not need to be. This allows installing multiple copies of the same application. You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or Instant Press CMS created by Martin Mulone:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or one of the many example applications available at:

``
http://web2py.com/appliances
``

------
Web2py files are packages as ``.w2p`` files. These ones are tar gzipped files. Web2py uses the ``.w2p`` extension instead of the ``.tgz`` extension to prevent the browser from unzipping on download. They can be uncompressed manually with ``tar zxvf [filename]`` although this is never necessary.
------

[[image @///image/en4100.png center 444px]]

Upon successful upload, web2py displays the MD5 checksum of the uploaded file. You can use it to verify that the file was not corrupted during upload. The InstantPress name will appear in the list of installed applications.

Click on the application name on admin to get it up and running.

If you run web2py from source and you have ``pyhton-git`` installed, you can install applications directly from git reporsitory using the ``.git`` URL in the upload form. In this case you will also be used to user the admin interface to push changes back into the repository.

For each application the &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page allows you to:
- Uninstall the application.
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Clean up temporary files (sessions, errors, and cache.disk files).
- Pack all. This returns a tar file containing a complete copy of the application. We suggest that you clean up temporary files before packing an application.
- Compile the application. If there are no errors, this option will bytecode-compile all models, controllers and views. Because views can extend and include other views in a tree, before bytecode compilation, the view tree for every controller is collapsed into a single file. The net effect is that a bytecode-compiled application is faster, because there is no more parsing of templates or string substitutions occurring at runtime.
- Pack compiled. This option is only present for bytecode-compiled applications. It allows packing the application without source code for distribution as closed source. Note that Python (as any other programming language) can technically be decompiled; therefore compilation does not provide complete protection of the source code. Nevertheless, decompilation can be difficult and can be illegal.
- Remove compiled. It simply removes the byte-code compiled models, views and controllers from the application. If the application was packaged with source code or edited locally, there is no harm in removing the bytecode-compiled files, and the application will continue to work. If the application was installed form a packed compiled file, then this is not safe, because there is no source code to revert to, and the application will no longer work.

``admin.py``:inxx

-------
All the functionality available from the web2py admin site page is also accessible programmatically via the API defined in the module ``gluon/admin.py``. Simply open a python shell and import this module.
-------

If the Google App Engine SDK is installer the admin &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page shows a button to push your applications to GAE. If ``python-git`` is installed, there is also a button to push your application to Open Shift. To install applications on ``heroku`` or other hosting system you should look into the &quot;scripts&quot; folder for the appropriate script.

#### About
``about``:inxx ``license``:inxx

The &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; tab allows editing the description of the application and its license. These are written respectively in the ABOUT and LICENSE files in the application folder.

[[image @///image/en4300.png center 480px]]

You can use ``MARKMIN``, or ``gluon.contrib.markdown.WIKI`` syntax for these files as described in ref.``markdown2``:cite .

#### Design
``EDIT``:inxx
You have used the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page already in this chapter. Here we want to point out a few more functionalities of the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page.
- If you click on any file name, you can see the contents of the file with syntax highlighting.
- If you click on edit, you can edit the file via a web interface.
- If you click on delete, you can delete the file (permanently).
- If you click on test, web2py will run tests. Tests are written by the developer using Python doctests, and each function should have its own tests.
- You can add language files, scan the app to discover all strings, and edit string translations via the web interface.
- If the static files are organized in folders and subfolders, the folder hierarchy can be toggled by clicking on a folder name.

The image below shows the output of the test page for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4400.png center 480px]]

The image below show the languages tab for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4500.png center 480px]]

The image below shows how to edit a language file, in this case the &quot;it&quot; (Italian) language for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4600.png center 480px]]

##### Intergated debugger

##### Shell

If you click on the &quot;shell&quot; link under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27;, web2py will open a web based Python shell and will execute the models for the current application. This allows you to interactively talk to your application.

[[image @///image/en4700.png center 480px]]

##### Crontab

Also under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; there is a &quot;crontab&quot; link. By clicking on this link you will be able to edit the web2py crontab file. This follows the same syntax as the unix crontab but does not rely on unix. In fact, it only requires web2py, and it works on Windows. It allows you to register actions that need to be executed in background at scheduled times.
For more information about this, see the next chapter.

#### Errors
``errors``:inxx

When programming web2py, you will inevitably make mistakes and introduce bugs. web2py helps in two ways: 1) it allows you to create tests for every function that can be run in the browser from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page; and 2) when an error manifests itself, a ticket is issued to the visitor and the error is logged.

Intentionally introduce an error in the images application as shown below:
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL,orderby=db.image.title)
    1/0
    return dict(images=images)
``:code

When you access the index action, you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en4800.png center 480px]]

Only the administrator can access the ticket:

[[image @///image/en4900.png center 480px]]

The ticket shows the traceback, and the content of the file that caused the problem, and the complete state of system (variables, request, session, etc.) If the error occurs in a view, web2py shows the view converted from HTML into Python code. This allows to easily identify the logical structure of the file.

By default tickets are stored on filesystem and group by traceback. The administrative interface provides an aggregate views (type of traceback and number of occurrence) and a detailed view (all tickets are listed by ticket id). The administrator can switch between the two views.

Notice that everywhere **admin** shows syntax-highlighted code (for example, in error reports, web2py keywords are shown in orange). If you click on a web2py keyword, you are redirected to a documentation page about the keyword.

If you fix the divide-by-zero bug in the index action and introduce one in the index view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}

&lt;h1&gt;Current Images&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{{for image in images:}}
{{1/0}}
{{=LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&quot;show&quot;, args=image.id)))}}
{{pass}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en5000.png center 480px]]

Note that web2py has converted the view from HTML into a Python file, and the error described in the ticket refers to the generated Python code and NOT to the original view file:

[[image @///image/en5100.png center 480px]]

This may seem confusing at first, but in practice it makes debugging easier, because the Python indentation highlights the logical structure of the code that you embedded in the views.

The code is shown at the bottom of the same page.

All tickets are listed under admin in the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page for each application:

[[image @///image/en5200.png center 480px]]

#### Mercurial
``Mercurial``:inxx

If you are running from source and you have the Mercurial version control libraries installed:
``
easy_install mercurial
``:code

then the administrative interface shows one more menu item called &quot;Versioning&quot;. It automatically creates a local Mercurial repository for the application. Pressing the &quot;commit&quot; button in the page will commit the current application. Mercurial creates and stores information about changes you make in your code into a hidden folder &quot;.hg&quot; in your app subfolder. Every app has its own &quot;.hg&quot; folder and its own &quot;.hgignore&quot; file (tells Mercurial which files to ignore).

The Mercurial web interface does allow you to browse previous commit and diff files but we do recommend you use Mercurial directly from the shell or one of the many GUI-based Mercurial clients since they are more powerful. For example they will allow you sync your app with a remote source repository:

[[images @///image/en5300.png center 480px]]


You can read more about Mercurial here:
``
http://mercurial.selenic.com/
``

#### Application Wizard (experimental)

The **admin** interface includes a Wizard that can help you create a new applications.
You can access the wizard from the &quot;sites&quot; page as shown in the image below.

[[image @///image/en5400.png center 480px]]

The wizard will guide you through a series of steps involved in creating a new application:

- Chose a name for the application
- Configure the application and choose required plugins
- Build required models (it will create CRUD pages for each model)
- Allow you to edit the views of those pages using MARKMIN syntax

The image below shows the second step of the process.

[[image @///image/en5500.png center 480px]]

You can see a dropdown to select a layout plugin (from ``web2py.com/layouts``), a multiple choice dropdown to check other plugins (from ``web2py.com/plugins``) and a &quot;login config&quot; field where to put the Janrain &quot;domain:key&quot;.

The other steps are pretty much self-explanatory.

The Wizard works well for what it does but it is considered an &#x27;&#x27;experimental feature&#x27;&#x27; for two reasons:

- Applications created with the wizard and edited manually, cannot later be modified by the wizard.
- The interface of the wizard will change over time to include support for more features and easier visual development.

In any case the wizard is a handy tool for fast prototyping and it can be used to bootstrap a new application with an alternate layout and optional plugins.

#### Configuring **admin**

Normally there is no need to perform any configuration of admin but a few customizations are possible. After you login into admin you can edit the admin configuration file via the URL:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/edit/admin/models/0.py
``
Notice that **admin** can be used to edit itself. In fact **admin** is an app as any other one.

The file &quot;0.py&quot; is very much self documented and if you are opening probably you already know what you are looking for. Anyway few customizations exist that are more important than others:

``
GAE_APPCFG = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(&#x27;/usr/local/bin/appcfg.py&#x27;))
``
This should point to the location of the &quot;appcfg.py&quot; file that comes with the Google App Engine SDK. If you have the SDK you may want to change this config parameters to the correct value. It will allow you to deploy to GAE from the admin interface.

``DEMO_MODE``:inxx

You can also set web2py admin in demo mode:
``
DEMO_MODE = True
FILTER_APPS = [&#x27;welcome&#x27;]
``
And only the apps listed in filter apps will be accessible and they will be only accessible in read-only mode.

``MULTI_USER_MODE``:inxx
``virtual laboratory``:inxx

If you are a teacher and want to expose the administrative interface to students so that students can share one administrative interface for their projects (think of a virtual lab), can do it by setting:
``
MULTI_USER_MODE = True
``
In this way students will be required to login and will only be able to access their own apps via admin. You, as first user/teacher, will be able to access them all.

In multi user mode, you can register students using the &quot;bulk register&quot; link in admin and manage them using the &quot;manage students&quot; link. The system also keep track of when students login and how many lines of code add/remove to/from their code. This data is presented to the administrator as charts under the application &quot;about&quot; page.

Mind that this mechanism still assumes all users are trusted. All the apps created under admin run under the same credentials on the same filesystem. It is possible for an app created by a student to access the data and the source of an app created by another student. It is also possible for a student to create an app that locks the server.

#### Mobile **admin**

Notice that the admin application includes &quot;plugin_jqmodile&quot; which packages jQuery Mobile. When admin is accessed from a mobile devide, this is detected by web2py and the interface is displayed using a mobile friendly layout.

### More on **appadmin**

``appadmin``:inxx

**appadmin** is not intended to be exposed to the public. It is designed to help you by providing an easy access to the database. It consists of only two files: a controller &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and a view &quot;appadmin.html&quot; which are used by all actions in the controller.

The **appadmin** controller is relatively small and readable; it provides an example of designing a database interface.

**appadmin** shows which databases are available and which tables exist in each database. You can insert records and list all records for each table individually. **appadmin** paginates output 100 records at a time.

Once a set of records is selected, the header of the pages changes, allowing you to update or delete the selected records.

To update the records, enter an SQL assignment in the Query string field:
``
title = &#x27;test&#x27;
``:code

where string values must be enclosed in single quotes. Multiple fields can be separated by commas.

To delete a record, click the corresponding checkbox to confirm that you are sure.

**appadmin** can also perform joins if the SQL FILTER contains a SQL condition that involves two or more tables. For example, try:
``
db.image.id == db.comment.image_id
``:code

web2py passes this along to the DAL, and it understands that the query links two tables; hence, both tables are selected with an INNER JOIN. Here is the output:

[[image @///image/en5600.png center 480px]]

If you click on the number of an id field, you get an edit page for the record with the corresponding id.

If you click on the number of a reference field, you get an edit page for the referenced record.

You cannot update or delete rows selected by a join, because they involve records from multiple tables and this would be ambiguous.

In addition to its database administration capabilities, **appadmin** also enables you to view details about the contents of the application&#x27;s ``cache`` (at ``/yourapp/appadmin/ccache``) as well as the contents of the current ``request``, ``response``, and ``session`` objects (at ``/yourapp/appadmin/state``).

------
**appadmin** replaces ``response.menu`` with its own menu, which provides links to the application&#x27;s **edit** page in **admin**, the **db** (database administration) page, the **state** page, and the **cache** page. If your application&#x27;s layout does not generate a menu using ``response.menu``, then you will not see the **appadmin** menu. In that case, you can modify the appadmin.html file and add ``{{=MENU(response.menu)}}`` to display the menu.

### Startup

``Linux``:inxx ``Mac``:inxx ``Windows``:inxx

web2py comes in binary packages for Windows and Mac OS X. They include the Python interpreter so you do not need to have it pre-installed. There is also a source code version that runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and other Unix systems. The Windows and OS X binary versions include the necessary Python interpreter. The source code package assumes that Python is already installed on the computer.

web2py requires no installation. To get started, unzip the downloaded zip file for your specific operating system and execute the corresponding ``web2py`` file.

On Unix and Linux (source distribution), run:
``
python web2py.py
``:code

On OS X (binary distribution), run:
``
open web2py.app
``:code

On Windows (binary web2py distribution), run:
``
web2py.exe
``:code

On Windows (source web2py distribution), run:
``
c:/Python27/python.exe web2py.exe
``:code

Attention, to run web2py on Windows from source you must install first Mark Hammond&#x27;s [[Python for Windows extensions http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/]]

The web2py program accepts various command line options which are discussed later.

By default, at startup, web2py displays a startup window and then displays a GUI widget that asks you to choose a one-time administrator password, the IP address of the network interface to be used for the web server, and a port number from which to serve requests. By default, web2py runs its web server on 127.0.0.1:8000 (port 8000 on localhost), but you can run it on any available IP address and port. You can query the IP address of your network interface by opening a command line and typing ``ipconfig`` on Windows or ``ifconfig`` on OS X and Linux. From now on we assume web2py is running on localhost (127.0.0.1:8000). Use 0.0.0.0:80 to run web2py publicly on any of your network interfaces.

[[image @///image/en400.png center 306px]]

If you do not provide an administrator password, the administration interface is disabled. This is a security measure to prevent publicly exposing the admin interface.

The administrative interface, **admin**, is only accessible from localhost unless you run web2py behind Apache with mod_proxy. If **admin** detects a proxy, the session cookie is set to secure and **admin** login does not work unless the communication between the client and the proxy goes over HTTPS; this is a security measure. All communications between the client and **admin** must always be local or encrypted; otherwise an attacker would be able to perform a man-in-the middle attack or a replay attack and execute arbitrary code on the server.

After the administration password has been set, web2py starts up the web browser at the page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
``:code

If the computer does not have a default browser, open a web browser and enter the URL.

[[image @///image/en500.png center 480px]]

Clicking on &quot;administrative interface&quot; takes you to the login page for the administration interface.

[[image @///image/en600.png center 480px]]

The administrator password is the password you chose at startup.
Notice that there is only one administrator, and therefore only one administrator password. For security reasons, the developer is asked to choose a new password every time web2py starts unless the &lt;recycle&gt; option is specified. This is distinct from the authentication mechanism in web2py applications.

After the administrator logs into web2py, the browser is redirected to the &quot;site&quot; page.

[[image @///image/en700.png center 480px]]

This page lists all installed web2py applications and allows the administrator to manage them.
web2py comes with three applications:
``admin``:inxx ``examples``:inxx ``welcome``:inxx ``scaffolding``:inxx
- An **admin** application, the one you are using right now.
- An **examples** application, with the online interactive documentation and a replica of the web2py official website.
- A **welcome** application. This is the basic template for any other web2py application. It is referred to as the scaffolding application. This is also the application that welcomes a user at startup.

``appliances``:inxx
Ready-to-use web2py applications are referred to as web2py &#x27;&#x27;appliances&#x27;&#x27;.  You can download many freely available appliances from ``appliances``:cite . web2py users are encouraged to submit new appliances, either in open-source or closed-source (compiled and packed) form.

From the **admin** application&#x27;s &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page, you can perform the following operations:
- **install** an application by completing the form on the bottom right of the page. Give a name to the application, select the file containing a packaged application or the URL where the application is located, and click &quot;submit&quot;.
- **uninstall** an application by clicking the corresponding button. There is a confirmation page.
- **create** a new application by choosing a name and clicking &quot;create&quot;.
- **package** an application for distribution by clicking on the corresponding button. A downloaded application is a tar file containing everything, including the database. You should not untar this file; it is automatically unpackaged by web2py when installed with **admin**.
- **clean up** an application&#x27;s temporary files, such as sessions, errors and cache files.
- **EDIT** an application.

When you create a new application using **admin**, it starts as a clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; scaffolding app with a &quot;models/db.py&quot; that creates a SQLite database, connects to it, instantiates Auth, Crud, and Service, configures them. It also provides a &quot;controller/default.py&quot; which exposes actions &quot;index&quot;, &quot;download&quot;, &quot;user&quot; for user management, and &quot;call&quot; for services. In the following, we assume that these files have been removed; we will be creating apps from scratch.

web2py also comes with a **wizard**, described later in this chapter, that can write an alternate scaffolding code for you based on layouts and plugins available on the web and based on high level description of the models.

### Simple examples

#### Say hello
``index``:inxx

Here, as an example, we create a simple web app that displays the message &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot; to the user. We will call this application &quot;myapp&quot;. We will also add a counter that counts how many times the same user visits the page.

You can create a new application simply by typing its name in the form on the top right of the **site** page in **admin**.

[[image @///image/en800.png center 447px]]

After you press [create], the application is created as a copy of the built-in welcome application.

[[image @///image/en900.png center 480px]]

To run the new application, visit:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp
``:code

Now you have a copy of the welcome application.

To edit an application, click on the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; button for the newly created application.

The **edit** page tells you what is inside the application.
Every web2py application consists of certain files, most of which fall into one of six categories:
- **models**: describe the data representation.
- **controllers**: describe the application logic and workflow.
- **views**: describe the data presentation.
- **languages**: describe how to translate the application presentation to other languages.
- **modules**: Python modules that belong to the application.
- **static files**: static images, CSS  files``css-w,css-o,css-school``:cite , JavaScript files``js-w,js-b``:cite , etc.
- **plugins**: groups of files designed to work together.
 
Everything is neatly organized following the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Each section in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page corresponds to a subfolder in the application folder.

Notice that section headings will toggle their content. Folder names under static files are also collapsible.

Each file listed in the section corresponds to a file physically located in the subfolder. Any operation performed on a file via the **admin** interface (create, edit, delete) can be performed directly from the shell using your favorite editor.

The application contains other types of files (database, session files, error files, etc.), but they are not listed on the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page because they are not created or modified by the administrator; they are created and modified by the application itself.

The controllers contain the logic and workflow of the application. Every URL gets mapped into a call to one of the functions in the controllers (actions). There are two default controllers: &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and &quot;default.py&quot;. **appadmin** provides the database administrative interface; we do not need it now. &quot;default.py&quot; is the controller that you need to edit, the one that is called by default when no controller is specified in the URL. Edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def index():
    return &quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;
``:code

Here is what the online editor looks like:

[[image @///image/en1000.png center 480px]]

Save it and go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. Click on the index link to visit the newly created page.

When you visit the URL
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/default/index
``:code

the index action in the default controller of the myapp application is called. It returns a string that the browser displays for us. It should look like this:

[[image @///image/en1100.png center 480px]]

Now, edit the &quot;index&quot; function as follows:
``
def index():
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;)
``:code

Also from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page, edit the view &quot;default/index.html&quot; (the view file associated with the action) and completely replace the existing contents of that file with the following:
``
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{=message}}&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
``:code

Now the action returns a dictionary defining a ``message``. When an action returns a dictionary, web2py looks for a view with the name

``[controller]/[function].[extension]``:code

 and executes it. Here [extension] is the requested extension. If no extension is specified, it defaults to &quot;html&quot;, and that is what we will assume here. Under this assumption, the view is an HTML file that embeds Python code using special {{ }} tags. In particular, in the example, the ``{{=message}}`` instructs web2py to replace the tagged code with the value of the ``message`` returned by the action. Notice that ``message`` here is not a web2py keyword but is defined in the action. So far we have not used any web2py keywords.

If web2py does not find the requested view, it uses the &quot;generic.html&quot; view that comes with every application.

``Mac Mail``:inxx ``Google Maps``:inxx ``jsonp``:inxx
If an extension other than &quot;html&quot; is specified (&quot;json&quot; for example), and the view file &quot;[controller]/[function].json&quot; is not found, web2py looks for the view &quot;generic.json&quot;. web2py comes with generic.html, generic.json, generic.jsonp, generic.xml, generic.rss, generic.ics (for Mac Mail Calendar), generic.map (for embedding Google Maps), and generic.pdf (based on fpdf). These generic views can be modified for each application individually, and additional views can be added easily.

Generic views are a development tool. In production every action should have its own view. In fact, by default, generic views are only enabled from localhost.

You can also specify a view with ``response.view = &#x27;default/something.html&#x27;``

Read more on this topic in Chapter 10.

If you go back to &quot;EDIT&quot; and click on index, you will now see the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1200.png center 480px]]

For debugging purposes you can always append

``
{{=response.toolbar()}}
``:code

to the code in a view and it will show you some useful information, including the request, response and session objects, and list all db queries with their timing.

#### Let&#x27;s count
``session``:inxx
Let&#x27;s now add a counter to this page that will count how many times the same visitor displays the page.

web2py automatically and transparently tracks visitors using sessions and cookies. For each new visitor, it creates a session and assigns a unique &quot;session_id&quot;. The session is a container for variables that are stored server-side. The unique id is sent to the browser via a cookie. When the visitor requests another page from the same application, the browser sends the cookie back, it is retrieved by web2py, and the corresponding session is restored.

To use the session, modify the default controller:
``
def index():
    if not session.counter:
        session.counter = 1
    else:
        session.counter += 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
``:code

Notice that ``counter`` is not a web2py keyword but ``session`` is. We are asking web2py to check whether there is a counter variable in the session and, if not, to create one and set it to 1. If the counter is there, we ask web2py to increase the counter by 1. Finally we pass the value of the counter to the view.

A more compact way to code the same function is this:
``
def index():
    session.counter = (session.counter or 0) + 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
``:code

Now modify the view to add a line that displays the value of the counter:
``
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{=message}}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Number of visits: {{=counter}}&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
``:code

When you visit the index page again (and again) you should get the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1300.png center 480px]]

The counter is associated with each visitor, and is incremented each time the visitor reloads the page. Different visitors see different counters.


#### Say my name
``form``:inxx ``request.vars``:inxx

Now create two pages (first and second), where the first page creates a form, asks the visitor&#x27;s name, and redirects to the second page, which greets the visitor by name.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1400.png center 200px]]

Write the corresponding actions in the default controller:
``
def first():
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then create a view &quot;default/first.html&quot; for the first action,
and enter:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;form action=&quot;second&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

Finally, create a view &quot;default/second.html&quot; for the second action:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=request.vars.visitor_name}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

``layout``:inxx
In both views we have extended the basic &quot;layout.html&quot; view that comes with web2py. The layout view keeps the look and feel of the two pages coherent. The layout file can be edited and replaced easily, since it mainly contains HTML code.

If you now visit the first page, type your name:

[[image @///image/en1500.png center 480px]]

and submit the form, you will receive a greeting:

[[image @///image/en1600.png center 480px]]

#### Postbacks
``redirect``:inxx ``URL``:inxx ``postback``:inxx

The mechanism for form submission that we used before is very common, but it is not good programming practice. All input should be validated and, in the above example, the burden of validation would fall on the second action. Thus the action that performs the validation is different from the action that generated the form. This tends to cause redundancy in the code.

A better pattern for form submission is to submit forms to the same action that generated them, in our example the &quot;first&quot;. The &quot;first&quot; action should receive the variables, process them, store them server-side, and redirect the visitor to the &quot;second&quot; page, which retrieves the variables. This mechanism is called a &#x27;&#x27;postback&#x27;&#x27;.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1700.png center 200px]]

Modify the default controller to implement self-submission:
``
def first():
    if request.vars.visitor_name:
        session.visitor_name = request.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then modify the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
What is your name?
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

and the &quot;default/second.html&quot; view needs to retrieve the data from the ``session`` instead of from the ``request.vars``:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=session.visitor_name or &quot;anonymous&quot;}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

From the point of view of the visitor, the self-submission behaves exactly the same as the previous implementation. We have not added validation yet, but it is now clear that validation should be performed by the first action.

This approach is better also because the name of the visitor stays in the session, and can be accessed by all actions and views in the applications without having to be passed around explicitly.

Note that if the &quot;second&quot; action is ever called before a visitor name is set, it will display &quot;Hello anonymous&quot; because  ``session.visitor_name`` returns ``None``. Alternatively we could have added the following code in the controller (inside the ``second`` function):

``
if not request.function==&#x27;first&#x27; and not session.visitor_name:
    redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
``:code

This is a general mechanism that you can use to enforce authorization on controllers, though see Chapter 9 for a more powerful method.

``FORM``:inxx ``INPUT``:inxx ``requires``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx

With web2py we can move one step further and ask web2py to generate the form for us, including validation. web2py provides helpers (FORM, INPUT, TEXTAREA, and SELECT/OPTION) with the same names as the equivalent HTML tags. They can be used to build forms either in the controller or in the view.

For example, here is one possible way to rewrite the first action:
``
def first():
    form = FORM(INPUT(_name=&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
              INPUT(_type=&#x27;submit&#x27;))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

where we are saying that the FORM tag contains two INPUT tags. The attributes of the input tags are specified by the named arguments starting with underscore. The ``requires`` argument is not a tag attribute (because it does not start by underscore) but it sets a validator for the value of visitor_name.

Here is yet another better way to create the same form:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, 
                                 label=&#x27;what is yout name?&#x27;,
                                 requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

The ``form`` object can be easily serialized in HTML by embedding it in the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view.
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=form}}
``:code

The ``form.process()`` method applies the validators and returns the form itself. The ``form.accepted`` variable is set to True if the form was processed and passed validation. If the self-submitted form passes validation, it stores the variables in the session and redirects as before. If the form does not pass validation, error messages are inserted into the form and shown to the user, as below:

[[image @///image/en1800.png center 480px]]

In the next section we will show how forms can be generated automatically from a model.

In all or examples we have used the session to pass the user name from the first action to the second. We could have used a different mechanism and pass data as part of a redirect URL:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;,vars=dict(name=name)))
    return dict(form=form)

def second():
    name = request.vars.visitor_name or redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
    return dict(name=name)
``:code

#### Internationalization

You code is likely to include hardcoded strings such as &quot;What is your name?&quot;. You should be able to customize strings without editing the code and in particular insert translations for these strings in different languages. In this wasy if a visitor has the language preference of the browser set to &quot;Italian&quot;, web2py will use the Italian translation for the strings, if available. This feature of web2py is called &quot;internationalization&quot; and it is described in more detail in the next chapter.

Here we just observe that in order to use this feature you should markup strings that need stranslation. This is done by wrapping a a quoted string in code such as 

``
&quot;What is your name?&quot;
``:code

with the ``T`` operator:

``
T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)
``:code


You can also mark fo translations strings hardcoded in views. For example

``
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

becomes

``
&lt;h1&gt;{{=T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

It is good practice to do this for every string in the code (field labels, flash messages, etc.) except for tables and field names.

Once the strings are indentified and marked up, web2py takes care of almost evrything else. The admin interface also provides a page where you can translate each string in the languages you desire to support.

### An image blog
``upload``:inxx

Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments.

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,

``:code

Let&#x27;s analyze this line by line.

Line 1 defines a global variable called ``db`` that represents the database connection. In this case it is a connection to a SQLite database stored in the file  &quot;applications/images/databases/storage.sqlite&quot;. In the SQLite case, if the database does not exist, it is created. You can change the name of the file, as well as the name of the global variable ``db``, but it is convenient to give them the same name, to make it easy to remember.

Lines 3-5 define a table &quot;image&quot;. ``define_table`` is a method of the ``db`` object. The first argument, &quot;image&quot;, is the name of the table we are defining. The other arguments are the fields belonging to that table. This table has a field called &quot;title&quot;, a field called &quot;file&quot;, and a field called &quot;id&quot; that serves as the table primary key (&quot;id&quot; is not explicitly declared because all tables have an id field by default). The field &quot;title&quot; is a string, and the field &quot;file&quot; is of type &quot;upload&quot;. &quot;upload&quot; is a special type of field used by the web2py Data Abstraction Layer (DAL) to store the names of uploaded files. web2py knows how to upload files (via streaming if they are large), rename them safely, and store them.

When a table is defined, web2py takes one of several possible actions:
- if the table does not exist, the table is created;
- if the table exists and does not correspond to the definition, the table is altered accordingly, and if a field has a different type, web2py tries to convert its contents;
- if the table exists and corresponds to the definition, web2py does nothing.

This behavior is called &quot;migration&quot;. In web2py migrations are automatic, but can be disabled for each table by passing ``migrate=False`` as the last argument of ``define_table``.

Line 6 defines a format string for the table. It determines how a record should be represented as a string. Notice that the ``format`` argument can also be a function that takes a record and returns a string. For example:

``
format=lambda row: row.title
``:code

Lines 8-12 define another table called &quot;comment&quot;.
A comment has an &quot;author&quot;, an &quot;email&quot; (we intend to store the email address of the author of the comment), a &quot;body&quot; of type &quot;text&quot; (we intend to use it to store the actual comment posted by the author), and an &quot;image_id&quot; field of type reference that points to ``db.image`` via the &quot;id&quot; field.

In line 14, ``db.image.title`` represents the field &quot;title&quot; of table &quot;image&quot;. The attribute ``requires`` allows you to set requirements/constraints that will be enforced by web2py forms. Here we require that the &quot;title&quot; is unique:

``IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)``:code

&#x27;&#x27;Notice this is optional because it is set automatically given that ``Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True)``&#x27;&#x27;.

The objects representing these constraints are called validators. Multiple validators can be grouped in a list. Validators are executed in the order they appear.
``IS_NOT_IN_DB(a, b)`` is a special validator that checks that the value of a field ``b`` for a new record is not already in ``a``.

Line 15 requires that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;comment&quot; is in ``db.image.id``. As far as the database is concerned, we had already declared this  when we defined the table &quot;comment&quot;.
Now we are explicitly telling the model that this condition should be enforced by web2py, too, at the form processing level when a new comment is posted, so that invalid values do not propagate from input forms to the database. We also require that the &quot;image_id&quot; be represented by the &quot;title&quot;, ``&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;``, of the corresponding record.

Line 20 indicates that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;comment&quot; should not be shown in forms, ``writable=False`` and not even in readonly forms, ``readable=False``.

The meaning of the validators in lines 15-17 should be obvious.

``format``:inxx
Notice that the validator
``
db.comment.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

can be omitted (and would be automatic) if we specify a format for referenced table:
``
db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;, ..., format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

where the format can be a string or a function that takes a record and returns a string.

``appadmin``:inxx
Once a model is defined, if there are no errors, web2py creates an application administration interface to manage the database. You access it via the &quot;database administration&quot; link in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page or directly:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/appadmin
``:code

Here is a screenshot of the **appadmin** interface:

[[image @///image/en2100.png center 480px]]

This interface is coded in the controller called &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and the corresponding view &quot;appadmin.html&quot;. From now on, we will refer to this interface simply as **appadmin**. It allows the administrator to insert new database records, edit and delete existing records, browse tables, and perform database joins.

The first time **appadmin** is accessed, the model is executed and the tables are created. The web2py DAL translates Python code into SQL statements that are specific to the selected database back-end (SQLite in this example). You can see the generated SQL from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page by clicking on the &quot;sql.log&quot; link under &quot;models&quot;. Notice that the link is not present until the tables have been created.

[[image @///image/en2200.png center 480px]]

If you were to edit the model and access **appadmin** again, web2py would generate SQL to alter the existing tables. The generated SQL is logged into &quot;sql.log&quot;.

Now go back to **appadmin** and try to insert a new image record:

[[image @///image/en2300.png center 480px]]

web2py has translated the ``db.image.file`` &quot;upload&quot; field into an upload form for the file. When the form is submitted and an image file is uploaded, the file is renamed in a secure way that preserves the extension, it is saved with the new name under the application &quot;uploads&quot; folder, and the new name is stored in the ``db.image.file`` field. This process is designed to prevent directory traversal attacks.

Notice that each field type is rendered by a &#x27;&#x27;widget&#x27;&#x27;. Default widgets can be overridden.

When you click on a table name in **appadmin**, web2py performs a select of all records on the current table, identified by the DAL query
``
db.image.id &gt; 0
``:code

and renders the result.

[[image @///image/en2400.png center 480px]]

You can select a different set of records by editing the SQL query and pressing [Submit].

To edit or delete a single record, click on the record id number.

Because of the ``IS_IN_DB`` validator, the reference field &quot;image_id&quot; is rendered by a drop-down menu. The items in the drop-down are stored as keys (``db.image.id``), but are represented by their ``db.image.title``, as specified by the validator.

Validators are powerful objects that know how to represent fields, filter field values, generate errors, and format values extracted from the field.

The following figure shows what happens when you submit a form that does not pass validation:

[[image @///image/en2500.png center 480px]]

The same forms that are automatically generated by **appadmin** can also be generated programmatically via the ``SQLFORM`` helper and embedded in user applications. These forms are CSS-friendly, and can be customized.

Every application has its own **appadmin**; therefore, **appadmin** itself can be modified without affecting other applications.

So far, the application knows how to store data, and we have seen how to access the database via **appadmin**. Access to **appadmin** is restricted to the administrator, and it is not intended as a production web interface for the application; hence the next part of this walk-through. Specifically we want to create:
- An &quot;index&quot; page that lists all available images sorted by title and links to detail pages for the images.
- A &quot;show/[id]&quot; page that shows the visitor the requested image and allows the visitor to view and post comments.
- A &quot;download/[name]&quot; action to download uploaded images.

This is represented schematically here:

[[yUML diagram @///image/en2600.png center 480px]]

Go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page and edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller, replacing its contents with the following:

``select``:inxx
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
    return dict(images=images)
``:code

This action returns a dictionary. The keys of the items in the dictionary are interpreted as variables passed to the view associated to the action. When developing, if there is no view, the action is rendered by the &quot;generic.html&quot; view that is provided with every web2py application.

The index action performs a select of all fields (``db.image.ALL``) from table image, ordered by ``db.image.title``. The result of the select is a ``Rows`` object containing the records. Assign it to a local variable called ``images`` returned by the action to the view. ``images`` is iterable and its elements are the selected rows. For each row the columns can be accessed as dictionaries:
``images[0][&#x27;title&#x27;]`` or equivalently as ``images[0].title``.

If you do not write a view, the dictionary is rendered by &quot;views/generic.html&quot; and a call to the index action would look like this:

[[image @///image/en2700.png center 480px]]

You have not created a view for this action yet, so web2py renders the set of records in plain tabular form.

Proceed to create a view for the index action. Return to admin, edit &quot;default/index.html&quot; and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Current Images&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{{for image in images:}}
{{=LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&quot;show&quot;, args=image.id)))}}
{{pass}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

The first thing to notice is that a view is pure HTML with special {{...}} tags. The code embedded in {{...}} is pure Python code with one caveat: indentation is irrelevant. Blocks of code start with lines ending in colon (:) and end in lines beginning with the keyword ``pass``. In some cases the end of a block is obvious from context and the use of ``pass`` is not required.

Lines 5-7 loop over the image rows and for each row image display:
``
LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id))
``:code

This is a ``&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;`` tag that contains an ``&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;`` tag which contains the ``image.title``. The value of the hypertext reference (href attribute) is:
``
URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id)
``:code

i.e., the URL within the same application and controller as the current request that calls the function called &quot;show&quot;, passing a single argument to the function, ``args=image.id``.
``LI``, ``A``, etc. are web2py helpers that map to the corresponding HTML tags. Their unnamed arguments are interpreted as objects to be serialized and inserted in the tag&#x27;s innerHTML. Named arguments starting with an underscore (for example ``_href``) are interpreted as tag attributes but without the underscore. For example ``_href`` is the ``href`` attribute, ``_class`` is the ``class`` attribute, etc.

As an example, the following statement:
``
{{=LI(A(&#x27;something&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=123))}}
``:code

is rendered as:
``
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/default/show/123&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
``:code

A handful of helpers (``INPUT``, ``TEXTAREA``, ``OPTION`` and ``SELECT``) also support some special named attributes not starting with underscore (``value``, and ``requires``). They are important for building custom forms and will be discussed later.

Go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. It now indicates that &quot;default.py exposes index&quot;. By clicking on &quot;index&quot;, you can visit the newly created page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/index
``:code

which looks like:

[[image @///image/en2800.png center 480px]]

If you click on the image name link, you are directed to:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/1
``:code

and this results in an error, since you have not yet created an action called &quot;show&quot; in controller &quot;default.py&quot;.

Let&#x27;s edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller and replace its content with:

``SQLFORM``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx ``response.flash``:inxx ``request.args``:inxx
``response.download``:inxx
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
    return dict(images=images)

def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = SQLFORM(db.comment)
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = &#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)

def download():
    return response.download(request, db)
``:code

The controller contains two actions: &quot;show&quot; and &quot;download&quot;.
The &quot;show&quot; action selects the image with the ``id`` parsed from the request args and all comments related to the image. &quot;show&quot; then passes everything to the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

The image id referenced by:
``
URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id)
``:code

in &quot;default/index.html&quot;, can be accessed as:

``request.args(0,cast=int)``

from the &quot;show&quot; action. The ``cast=int`` argument is optional but very important. It attempts to cast the string value passed in the PATH_INFO into an int. On failure it raise a proper exception instead of causing a ticket. One can also specify a redirect in case of failure to cast:

``request.args(0,cast=int,otherwise=URL(&#x27;error&#x27;))``

Moreover ``db.image(...)`` is a shortcut for 

``
db(db.image.id==...).select().first()
``:code

The &quot;download&quot; action expects a filename in ``request.args(0)``, builds a path to the location where that file is supposed to be, and sends it back to the client. If the file is too large, it streams the file without incurring any memory overhead.

Notice the following statements:
- Line 7 creates an insert form SQLFORM for the ``db.comment`` table using only the specified fields.
- Line 8 sets the value for the reference field, which is not part of the input form because it is not in the list of fields specified above.
- Line 9 processes the submitted form (the submitted form variables are in ``request.vars``) within the current session (the session is used to prevent double submissions, and to enforce navigation). If the submitted form variables are validated, the new comment is inserted in the ``db.comment`` table; otherwise the form is modified to include error messages (for example, if the author&#x27;s email address is invalid). This is all done in line 9!.
- Line 10 is only executed if the form is accepted, after the record is inserted into the database table. ``response.flash`` is a web2py variable that is displayed in the views and used to notify the visitor that something happened.
- Line 11 selects all comments that reference the current image.

The &quot;download&quot; action is already defined in the &quot;default.py&quot; controller of the scaffolding application.

The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view. The &quot;show&quot; action, though, should have a view, so return to **admin** and create a new view called &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;
     src=&quot;{{=URL(&#x27;download&#x27;, args=image.file)}}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
{{if len(comments):}}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  {{for comment in comments:}}
    &lt;p&gt;{{=comment.author}} says &lt;i&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  {{pass}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{else:}}
  &lt;h2&gt;No comments posted yet&lt;/h2&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

This view displays the **image.file** by calling the &quot;download&quot; action inside an ``&lt;img ... /&gt;`` tag.
If there are comments, it loops over them and displays each one.

Here is how everything will appear to a visitor.

[[image @///image/en2900.png center 480px]]

When a visitor submits a comment via this page, the comment is stored in the database and appended at the bottom of the page.

#### Adding authentication

The web2py API for Role-Based Access Control is quite sophisticated, but for now we will limit ourselves to restricting access to the show action to authenticated users, deferring a more detailed discussion to Chapter 9.

To limit access to authenticated users, we need to complete three steps. In a model, for example &quot;db.py&quot;, we need to add:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables(username=True)
``:code

In our controller, we need to add one action:
``
def user():
    return dict(form=auth())
``:code

This is sufficient to enable login, register, logout, etc. pages. The default layout will also show options to the corresponding pages in the top right corner.

[[image @///image/en3000.png center 300px]]

We can now decorate the functions that we want to restrict, for example:
``
@auth.requires_login()
def show():
    ...
``:code

Any attempt to access
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/[image_id]
``:code

will require login. If the user is not logged it, the user will be redirected to
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/login
``:code

[[image @///image/en3100.png center 480px]]

The ``user`` function also exposes, among others, the following actions:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/logout
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/register
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/profile
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/change_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/request_reset_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_username
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/verify_email
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/impersonate
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/not_authorized
``:code

Now, a first-time user needs to register in order to be able to log in and read or post comments.

Both the ``auth`` object and the ``user`` function are already defined in the scaffolding application. The ``auth`` object is highly customizable and can deal with email verification, registration approvals, CAPTCHA, and alternate login methods via plugins.

#### Adding grids

We can improve this further using the ``SQLFORM.grid`` and ``SQLFORM.smartgrid`` gadgets to create a management interface for our application:

``
@auth.requires_membership(&#x27;manager&#x27;)
def manage():
    grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.image,linked_tables=[&#x27;comment&#x27;])
    return dict(grid=grid)
``:code

with associated &quot;views/default/manage.html&quot;

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;Management Interface&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``

Using appadmin create a group &quot;manager&quot; and make some users members of the group. They will not be able to access

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/manage
``

and browse, search:

[[image @///image/en3200.png center 480px]]

create, update and delete images and their comments:

[[image @///image/en3300.png center 480px]]

#### Configuring the layout

You can configure the default layout by editing &quot;views/layout.html&quot; but you can also configure it without editing the HTML. In fact, the &quot;static/base.css&quot; stylesheet is well documented and described in Chapter 5. You can change color, columns, size, borders and background without editing the HTML. If you want to edit the menu, the title or the subtitle, you can do so in any model file. The scaffolding app, sets default values of these parameters in the file &quot;models/menu.py&quot;:

``
response.title = request.application
response.subtitle = &#x27;customize me!&#x27;
response.meta.author = &#x27;you&#x27;
response.meta.description = &#x27;describe your app&#x27;
response.meta.keywords = &#x27;bla bla bla&#x27;
response.menu = [ [ &#x27;Index&#x27;, False, URL(&#x27;index&#x27;) ] ]
``:code

### A simple wiki
``wiki``:inxx ``RSS``:inxx ``Ajax``:inxx ``XMLRPC``:inxx

In this section, we build a simple wiki from scratch using only low level APIs (as opposed to using the built-in wiki capabilities of web2py demonstrated in the next section). The visitor will be able to create pages, search them (by title), and edit them. The visitor will also be able to post comments (exactly as in the previous applications), and also post documents (as attachments to the pages) and link them from the pages. As a convention, we adopt the Markmin syntax for our wiki syntax. We will also implement a search page with Ajax, an RSS feed for the pages, and a handler to search the pages via XML-RPC``xmlrpc``:cite . The following diagram lists the actions that we need to implement and the links we intend to build among them.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en3400.png center 200px]]

Start by creating a new scaffolding app, naming it &quot;mywiki&quot;.

The model must contain three tables: page, comment, and document. Both comment and document reference page because they belong to page. A document contains a file field of type upload as in the previous images application.

Here is the complete model:
``
db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)

from gluon.tools import *
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
crud = Crud(db)

db.define_table(&#x27;page&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;title&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id))

db.define_table(&#x27;document&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;name&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(name)s&#x27;)

db.page.title.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, &#x27;page.title&#x27;)
db.page.body.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()
db.page.created_by.readable = db.page.created_by.writable = False
db.page.created_on.readable = db.page.created_on.writable = False

db.comment.body.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()

db.comment.created_by.readable = db.comment.created_by.writable = False
db.comment.created_on.readable = db.comment.created_on.writable = False

db.document.name.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, &#x27;document.name&#x27;)
db.document.page_id.readable = db.document.page_id.writable = False
db.document.created_by.readable = db.document.created_by.writable = False
db.document.created_on.readable = db.document.created_on.writable = False
``:code

Edit the controller &quot;default.py&quot; and create the following actions:
- index: list all wiki pages
- create: post another wiki page
- show: show a wiki page and its comments, and append comments
- edit: edit an existing page
- documents: manage the documents attached to a page
- download: download a document (as in the images example)
- search: display a search box and, via an Ajax callback, return all matching titles as the visitor types
- callback: the Ajax callback function. It returns the HTML that gets embedded in the search page while the visitor types.

Here is the &quot;default.py&quot; controller:
``
def index():
     &quot;&quot;&quot; this controller returns a dictionary rendered by the view
         it lists all wiki pages
     &gt;&gt;&gt; index().has_key(&#x27;pages&#x27;)
     True

``:code


Lines 2-6 provide a comment for the index action. Lines 4-5 inside the comment are interpreted by python as test code (doctest). Tests can be run via the admin interface. In this case the tests verify that the index action runs without errors.

Lines 18, 27, and 35 try to fetch a ``page`` record with the id in 
``request.args(0)``.

Lines 13, 20 define and process create forms for a new page and a new comment and.

Line 28 defines and processes an update form for a wiki page.

Line 38 creates a ``grid`` object that allows to browser, add and update the comments linked to a page.

Some magic happens in line 51. The ``onkeyup`` attribute of the INPUT tag &quot;keyword&quot; is set. Every time the visitor releases a key, the JavaScript code inside the ``onkeyup`` attribute is executed, client-side. Here is the JavaScript code:
``
ajax(&#x27;callback&#x27;, [&#x27;keyword&#x27;], &#x27;target&#x27;);
``:code
``ajax`` is a JavaScript function defined in the file &quot;web2py.js&quot; which is included by the default &quot;layout.html&quot;. It takes three parameters: the URL of the action that performs the synchronous callback, a list of the IDs of variables to be sent to the callback ([&quot;keyword&quot;]), and the ID where the response has to be inserted (&quot;target&quot;).

As soon as you type something in the search box and release a key, the client calls the server and sends the content of the &#x27;keyword&#x27; field, and, when the sever responds, the response is embedded in the page itself as the innerHTML of the &#x27;target&#x27; tag.

The &#x27;target&#x27; tag is a DIV defined in line 52. It could have been defined in the view as well.

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/create.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Create new wiki page&lt;/h1&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

If you visit the **create** page, you see the following:

[[image @///image/en3500.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/index.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Available wiki pages&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;search&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;search&#x27;))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;{{for page in pages:}}
     {{=LI(A(page.title, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=page.id)))}}
{{pass}}&lt;/ul&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;create page&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;create&#x27;))}} ]
``:code

It generates the following page:

[[image @///image/en3600.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;:

``markdown``:inxx ``MARKMIN``:inxx
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;{{=page.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;edit&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;edit&#x27;, args=request.args))}}
| {{=A(&#x27;documents&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;documents&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
{{for comment in comments:}}
  &lt;p&gt;{{=db.auth_user[comment.created_by].first_name}} on {{=comment.created_on}}
          says &lt;I&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

If you wish to use markdown syntax instead of markmin syntax:

``
from gluon.contrib.markdown import WIKI
``:code

and use ``WIKI`` instead of the ``MARKMIN`` helper.
Alternatively, you can choose to accept raw HTML instead of markmin syntax. In this case you would replace:
``
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
``:code

with:
``
{{=XML(page.body)}}
``:code

``sanitize``:inxx
(so that the XML does not get escaped, as by default web2py behavior).

This can be done better with:
``
{{=XML(page.body, sanitize=True)}}
``:code

By setting ``sanitize=True``, you tell web2py to escape unsafe XML tags such as &quot;&lt;script&gt;&quot;, and thus prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Now if, from the index page, you click on a page title, you can see the page that you have created:

[[image @///image/en3700.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/edit.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Edit wiki page&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;show&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

It generates a page that looks almost identical to the create page.

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/documents.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Documents for page: {{=page.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;show&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documents&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``:code

If, from the &quot;show&quot; page, you click on documents, you can now manage the documents attached to the page.

[[image @///image/en3800.png center 480px]]

Finally here is the code for the view &quot;default/search.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Search wiki pages&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;listall&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))}}]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=form}}&lt;br /&gt;{{=target_div}}
``:code

which generates the following Ajax search form:

[[image @///image/en3900.png center 480px]]

You can also try to call the callback action directly by visiting, for example, the following URL:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/callback?keyword=wiki
``:code

If you look at the page source you see the HTML returned by the callback:
``
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mywiki/default/show/4&quot;&gt;I made a Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

``rss``:inxx
Generating an RSS feed from the stored pages using web2py is easy because web2py includes ``gluon.contrib.rss2``. Just append the following action to the default controller:
``
def news():
    &quot;generates rss feed form the wiki pages&quot;
    reponse.generic_patterns = [&#x27;.rss&#x27;]
    pages = db().select(db.page.ALL, orderby=db.page.title)
    return dict(
       title = &#x27;mywiki rss feed&#x27;,
       link = &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/index&#x27;,
       description = &#x27;mywiki news&#x27;,
       created_on = request.now,
       items = [
          dict(title = row.title,
               link = URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=row.id),
               description = MARKMIN(row.body).xml(),
               created_on = row.created_on
               ) for row in pages])
``:code

and when you visit the page
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/news.rss
``:code

you see the feed (the exact output depends on the feed reader). Notice that the dict is automatically converted to RSS, thanks to the .rss extension in the URL.

[[image @///image/en4000.png center 480px]]

web2py also includes feedparser to read third-party feeds.

``XMLRPC``:inxx
Finally, let&#x27;s add an XML-RPC handler that allows searching the wiki programmatically:
``
service = Service()

@service.xmlrpc
def find_by(keyword):
     &quot;finds pages that contain keyword for XML-RPC&quot;
     return db(db.page.title.contains(keyword)).select().as_list()

def call():
    &quot;exposes all registered services, including XML-RPC&quot;
    return service()
``:code

Here, the handler action simply publishes (via XML-RPC), the functions specified in the list. In this case, ``find_by``. ``find_by`` is not an action (because it takes an argument). It queries the database with ``.select()`` and then extracts the records as a list with ``.response`` and returns the list.

Here is an example of how to access the XML-RPC handler from an external
Python program.
``
&gt;&gt;&gt; import xmlrpclib
&gt;&gt;&gt; server = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(
    &#x27;http://127.0.0.1:8000/mywiki/default/call/xmlrpc&#x27;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in server.find_by(&#x27;wiki&#x27;):
        print item[&#x27;created_on&#x27;], item[&#x27;title&#x27;]
``:code

The handler can be accessed from many other programming languages that understand XML-RPC, including C, C++, C# and Java.

#### On ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time`` format

There are three different representation for each of the field types ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time``:
- the database representation
- the internal web2py prepresentation
- the string representation in forms and tables

The database representation is an internal issue and does not affect the code. Internally, at the web2py level, they are stored as ``datetime.date``, ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.time`` object respectively and they can be manipulated as such:

``
for page in db(db.page).select():
    print page.title, page.day, page.month, page.year
``

When dates are converted to strings in forms they are converted using the ISO representation 
``
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
``

yet this representation in internationalized and you can use the admin stranslation page to change the format to an alternate one. For example:

``
%m/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S
``

Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications is already written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need declare that the application current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide and example of the built-in web2py wiki. 

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

Notice the API of the built-in wiki are still considered experimental and small changes are still possible.

Here we assume we are starting from cratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is undesrtood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You man make your own view for the this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. There is no need to call the action &quot;index&quot;.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have RULS like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_create
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_search
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_could
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_recent
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_edit/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_editmedia/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_preview/...
``

Try create more pages such as &quot;index&quot;, &quot;aboutus&quot;, and &quot;contactus&quot;.
Try edit them. 


The ``wiki`` method takes some optional arguments:

- ``render`` which defaults to ``&#x27;markmin&#x27;`` but can be set equal to ``&#x27;html&#x27;``. It termines the syntax of the wiki. We will discuss the makrmin wiki markup later. If you change it to HTML you may want to use a wysiwyg javascript editor such as TinyMCE of NicEdit.
- ``manage_permissions``. This is set to ``False`` by default and only recognizes permissions for &quot;wiki-editor&quot; and &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you change it to ``True`` the create/edit page will give the option to specify by names the groups whose members have permssion to read and edit the page. In this case is a group &quot;everybody&quot; to give read permission to everybody.
- ``force_prefix``. If set to something like ``&#x27;%(id)s-&#x27;`` it will restict authors (not editors) to create page with a prefix like &quot;[user id]-[page name]&quot;. The prefix can contain the id (&quot;%(id)s&quot;) or the username (&quot;%(username)s&quot;) or any other field from the auth_user table, as long as the corresponding column contains valid string that would pass URL validation.
- ``restrict_search``. This default to ``False`` and any logged-in user can search all wiki pages (but not necessary read or edit them). If set to ``True``, authors can search only their own pages, editors can search everything, other users cannot search anything.
- ``menugroups``. This defaults to ``None`` and it indictates that wiki management menu (search, create, edit, etc.) is always displayed. You can set it to a list of group names whose members only can see this menu, for exmaple ``[&#x27;wiki-editor&#x27;,&#x27;wiki-author&#x27;]``. Notice that even if the menu is exposed to everybody does not mean everybody is allowed to perform actions listed in the menu since they are regulated by the access control system.

The ``wiki`` method has some additional parameters which will be explained later: ``slug``, ``env``, and ``extra``.



#### MARKMIN basics

The MARKMIN syntax allows you to markup **bold** text using ``**bold**``, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27; text with ``&#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;``, ``code`` text with ``\`\`code\`\```. Titles must be prefixed by a #, sections by ##, and sub-sections by ###. Use a minus(-) to prefix an un-ordered item and plus(+) to prefix an ordered item. URLs are automatically into links. For example:

``
# This is title
## this is a section title
### this is a subsection title

Text can be **bold**, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;, !`!!`!code!`!!`! etc.
Learn more at:

http://web2py.com
``:code


You can use the ``extra`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to pass extra rendering rules to the MARKMIN helper. For example:

``
auth.wiki(extra=dict(verbatim=lambda text: verbatim))
``

In the varbatim function will preprocess all the input marked as varbatim

``
!`!!`!
hello world
!`!!`!:verbatim
``

You can find more information about the MARKMIN syntax in chapter 5.
``auth.wiki`` is more powerful than the barebone MARKMIN helpers. In fact it supports oembed and components.

You can use theS ``env`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to expose functions to your wiki.
For example:

``
auth.wiki(env=dict(join=lambda a,b,c:&quot;%s-%s-%s&quot; % (a,b,c)))
``

allows you to use the markup syntax:

``
@(join:1,2,3)
``


This call the join function passed as extra with parameters ``a,b,c=1,2,3`` and will be redered as ``1-2-3``.

#### Oembed protocol

You can type in (or cut-and-paste) any URL into a wiki page it normally is rendered as a link to the URL. There are exceptions:

- If the URL has an image extension, the link is embedded as an image, ``&lt;img/&gt;``.
- If the URL has an audio extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 audio ``&lt;audio/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a video extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 video ``&lt;video/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a MS Office or PDF extension, Google Doc Viewer is embedded, showing the content of the document (only works for public documents).
- If the URL points to a Youtube page, a Viemo page, or a Flickr page, web2py contacts the corrsponding web service and queries it about the propor way to embed the contect. This is done using the ``oembed`` protocol.

Here is a complete list of supported formats:
``
Image (.PNG, .GIF, .JPG, .JPEG)
Audio (.WAV, .OGG, .MP3)
Video (.MOV, .MPE, .MP4, .MPG, .MPG2, .MPEG, .MPEG4, .MOVIE)

This is implemeneted in the web2py file ``gluon.contrib.autolinks`` and specifically in the function ``expand_one``. You can extend oembed support by registering more services. This is done by appending an entry to the ``EMBED_MAPS`` list:

``
from gluon.contrib.autlinks import EMBED_MAPS
EMBED_MAPS.append((re.compile(&#x27;http://vimeo.com/\S*&#x27;),
                   &#x27;http://vimeo.com/api/oembed.json&#x27;))

#### Referencing wiki content

If you create a wiki page with slug &quot;contactus&quot; you can refer to this page as

``@+////contactus``:code

Here ``@+////`` stands for

``@+/app/controller/function/``:code

but &quot;app&quot;, &quot;controller&quot;, and &quot;function&quot; are omitted thus assuming default.

Similarly you can use the wiki menu to upload a media file (for example an image) linked to the page. The &quot;manage media&quot; page will show all files you have uploaded and will show the proper expression to link the media file. If, for example you upload a file &quot;test.jpg&quot; with title &quot;beach&quot;, the link expression will somthing like:

``@+////15/beach.jpg``:code

``@+////`` is the same prefix described before. ``15`` is the id of the record storing the media file. ``beach`` is the title. ``.jpg`` is the extension of the original file.

If you cut and paste ``@+////15/beach.jpg`` into wiki pages you embed the image.

Mind that media files are linked to pages and inherit access permission from the pages.

#### Wiki menus

If you create a page with slug &quot;wiki-menu&quot; page it will be interpreted as a description of the menu. Here is an example:

``
- Home &gt; @+////index
- Info &gt; @+////info
- web2py &gt; http://google.com
- - About us &gt; @+////aboutus
- - Countact us &gt; @+////contactus
``

Each line a menu item. We used double dash for nested menu ites. The ``&gt;`` symbols separates the menu item title from the menu item link.

Mind that the menu is appended to ``response.menu``. It does not replace it. The ``[wiki]`` menu tem with service functions is added automatically.

#### Service functions

If, for example, you want to use the wiki to create an editable sidebar you could create a page with ``slug=&quot;sidebar&quot;`` and then embed it in your layout.html with

``
{{=auth.wiki(slug=&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)}}
``:code

Notice that there is nothing special with the word &quot;sidebar&quot;. Any wiki page can be retrieved and emebdded in any point in your code. This allows you mix and match wiki functionalities with regular web2py functionalities.

You can also embed special wiki functions as the search by tags:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_search&#x27;)}}
``:code

or the tag cloud:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_cloud&#x27;)}}
``:code

#### Components

One of the most powerful function of the new web2py consists in the ability of embedding an action inside another action. We call this a component.

Consider the following model:

``
db.define_table(&#x27;thing&#x27;,Field(&#x27;name&#x27;,requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
``:code

and the following action:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage_things():
    return SQLFORM.grid(db.thing)
``:code

This action is special because it returns a widget/helper not a dict of objects. Now we can embed this ``manage_things`` action into any view, with

``
{{=LOAD(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;manage_things&#x27;,ajax=True)}}
``:code

This allows the visitor interact with the component via Ajax without reloadin the host page that embeds the widget. Basically the action is called via Ajax, inherits the stile of the host page, and capture all forms submissions and flash messages so that thye are handled within the current page. On top of this the ``SQLFORM.grid`` widget uses digitally signed URLs to restrict access. More informaiton about components can be found in chapter 13.

Components like the one above can be embedded into wiki pages using the MARKMIN syntax:

``
@{component:default/manage_things}
``

This simply tells web2py that we want to incude the &quot;manage_things&quot; action defined in the &quot;default&quot; controller as an Ajax &quot;component&quot;.

Most users will be able to build relatively complex applications simply by using ``auth.wiki`` to create pages and menus, and embedded custom components into wiki pages. Wiki can be tough as a mechanism to allow members of the group to create pages but they calso be though as a way to develop applications in a modular way.

### More on **admin**
``admin``:inxx

The administrative interface provides additional functionality that we briefly review here.

#### Site
``site``:inxx

This page lists all installed applications. There are two forms at the bottom.

The first of them allows creating a new application by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The second form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it. This can be its original name, but does not need to be. This allows installing multiple copies of the same application. You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or Instant Press CMS created by Martin Mulone:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or one of the many example applications available at:

``
http://web2py.com/appliances
``

Web2py files are packages as ``.w2p`` files. These ones are tar gzipped files. Web2py uses the ``.w2p`` extension instead of the ``.tgz`` extension to prevent the browser from unzipping on download. They can be uncompressed manually with ``tar zxvf [filename]`` although this is never necessary.

[[image @///image/en4100.png center 444px]]

Upon successful upload, web2py displays the MD5 checksum of the uploaded file. You can use it to verify that the file was not corrupted during upload. The InstantPress name will appear in the list of installed applications.

Click on the application name on admin to get it up and running.

If you run web2py from source and you have ``pyhton-git`` installed, you can install applications directly from git reporsitory using the ``.git`` URL in the upload form. In this case you will also be used to user the admin interface to push changes back into the repository.

For each application the &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page allows you to:
- Uninstall the application.
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Clean up temporary files (sessions, errors, and cache.disk files).
- Pack all. This returns a tar file containing a complete copy of the application. We suggest that you clean up temporary files before packing an application.
- Compile the application. If there are no errors, this option will bytecode-compile all models, controllers and views. Because views can extend and include other views in a tree, before bytecode compilation, the view tree for every controller is collapsed into a single file. The net effect is that a bytecode-compiled application is faster, because there is no more parsing of templates or string substitutions occurring at runtime.
- Pack compiled. This option is only present for bytecode-compiled applications. It allows packing the application without source code for distribution as closed source. Note that Python (as any other programming language) can technically be decompiled; therefore compilation does not provide complete protection of the source code. Nevertheless, decompilation can be difficult and can be illegal.
- Remove compiled. It simply removes the byte-code compiled models, views and controllers from the application. If the application was packaged with source code or edited locally, there is no harm in removing the bytecode-compiled files, and the application will continue to work. If the application was installed form a packed compiled file, then this is not safe, because there is no source code to revert to, and the application will no longer work.

``admin.py``:inxx

All the functionality available from the web2py admin site page is also accessible programmatically via the API defined in the module ``gluon/admin.py``. Simply open a python shell and import this module.

If the Google App Engine SDK is installer the admin &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page shows a button to push your applications to GAE. If ``python-git`` is installed, there is also a button to push your application to Open Shift. To install applications on ``heroku`` or other hosting system you should look into the &quot;scripts&quot; folder for the appropriate script.

#### About
``about``:inxx ``license``:inxx

The &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; tab allows editing the description of the application and its license. These are written respectively in the ABOUT and LICENSE files in the application folder.

[[image @///image/en4300.png center 480px]]

You can use ``MARKMIN``, or ``gluon.contrib.markdown.WIKI`` syntax for these files as described in ref.``markdown2``:cite .

#### Design
``EDIT``:inxx
You have used the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page already in this chapter. Here we want to point out a few more functionalities of the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page.
- If you click on any file name, you can see the contents of the file with syntax highlighting.
- If you click on edit, you can edit the file via a web interface.
- If you click on delete, you can delete the file (permanently).
- If you click on test, web2py will run tests. Tests are written by the developer using Python doctests, and each function should have its own tests.
- You can add language files, scan the app to discover all strings, and edit string translations via the web interface.
- If the static files are organized in folders and subfolders, the folder hierarchy can be toggled by clicking on a folder name.

The image below shows the output of the test page for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4400.png center 480px]]

The image below show the languages tab for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4500.png center 480px]]

The image below shows how to edit a language file, in this case the &quot;it&quot; (Italian) language for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4600.png center 480px]]

##### Intergated debugger

##### Shell

If you click on the &quot;shell&quot; link under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27;, web2py will open a web based Python shell and will execute the models for the current application. This allows you to interactively talk to your application.

[[image @///image/en4700.png center 480px]]

##### Crontab

Also under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; there is a &quot;crontab&quot; link. By clicking on this link you will be able to edit the web2py crontab file. This follows the same syntax as the unix crontab but does not rely on unix. In fact, it only requires web2py, and it works on Windows. It allows you to register actions that need to be executed in background at scheduled times.
For more information about this, see the next chapter.

#### Errors
``errors``:inxx

When programming web2py, you will inevitably make mistakes and introduce bugs. web2py helps in two ways: 1) it allows you to create tests for every function that can be run in the browser from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page; and 2) when an error manifests itself, a ticket is issued to the visitor and the error is logged.

Intentionally introduce an error in the images application as shown below:
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL,orderby=db.image.title)
    1/0
    return dict(images=images)
``:code

When you access the index action, you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en4800.png center 480px]]

Only the administrator can access the ticket:

[[image @///image/en4900.png center 480px]]

The ticket shows the traceback, and the content of the file that caused the problem, and the complete state of system (variables, request, session, etc.) If the error occurs in a view, web2py shows the view converted from HTML into Python code. This allows to easily identify the logical structure of the file.

By default tickets are stored on filesystem and group by traceback. The administrative interface provides an aggregate views (type of traceback and number of occurrence) and a detailed view (all tickets are listed by ticket id). The administrator can switch between the two views.

Notice that everywhere **admin** shows syntax-highlighted code (for example, in error reports, web2py keywords are shown in orange). If you click on a web2py keyword, you are redirected to a documentation page about the keyword.

If you fix the divide-by-zero bug in the index action and introduce one in the index view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}

&lt;h1&gt;Current Images&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{{for image in images:}}
{{1/0}}
{{=LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&quot;show&quot;, args=image.id)))}}
{{pass}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en5000.png center 480px]]

Note that web2py has converted the view from HTML into a Python file, and the error described in the ticket refers to the generated Python code and NOT to the original view file:

[[image @///image/en5100.png center 480px]]

This may seem confusing at first, but in practice it makes debugging easier, because the Python indentation highlights the logical structure of the code that you embedded in the views.

The code is shown at the bottom of the same page.

All tickets are listed under admin in the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page for each application:

[[image @///image/en5200.png center 480px]]

#### Mercurial
``Mercurial``:inxx

If you are running from source and you have the Mercurial version control libraries installed:
``
easy_install mercurial
``:code

then the administrative interface shows one more menu item called &quot;Versioning&quot;. It automatically creates a local Mercurial repository for the application. Pressing the &quot;commit&quot; button in the page will commit the current application. Mercurial creates and stores information about changes you make in your code into a hidden folder &quot;.hg&quot; in your app subfolder. Every app has its own &quot;.hg&quot; folder and its own &quot;.hgignore&quot; file (tells Mercurial which files to ignore).

The Mercurial web interface does allow you to browse previous commit and diff files but we do recommend you use Mercurial directly from the shell or one of the many GUI-based Mercurial clients since they are more powerful. For example they will allow you sync your app with a remote source repository:

[[images @///image/en5300.png center 480px]]


You can read more about Mercurial here:
``
http://mercurial.selenic.com/
``

#### Application Wizard (experimental)

The **admin** interface includes a Wizard that can help you create a new applications.
You can access the wizard from the &quot;sites&quot; page as shown in the image below.

[[image @///image/en5400.png center 480px]]

The wizard will guide you through a series of steps involved in creating a new application:

- Chose a name for the application
- Configure the application and choose required plugins
- Build required models (it will create CRUD pages for each model)
- Allow you to edit the views of those pages using MARKMIN syntax

The image below shows the second step of the process.

[[image @///image/en5500.png center 480px]]

You can see a dropdown to select a layout plugin (from ``web2py.com/layouts``), a multiple choice dropdown to check other plugins (from ``web2py.com/plugins``) and a &quot;login config&quot; field where to put the Janrain &quot;domain:key&quot;.

The other steps are pretty much self-explanatory.

The Wizard works well for what it does but it is considered an &#x27;&#x27;experimental feature&#x27;&#x27; for two reasons:

- Applications created with the wizard and edited manually, cannot later be modified by the wizard.
- The interface of the wizard will change over time to include support for more features and easier visual development.

In any case the wizard is a handy tool for fast prototyping and it can be used to bootstrap a new application with an alternate layout and optional plugins.

#### Configuring **admin**

Normally there is no need to perform any configuration of admin but a few customizations are possible. After you login into admin you can edit the admin configuration file via the URL:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/edit/admin/models/0.py
``
Notice that **admin** can be used to edit itself. In fact **admin** is an app as any other one.

The file &quot;0.py&quot; is very much self documented and if you are opening probably you already know what you are looking for. Anyway few customizations exist that are more important than others:

``
GAE_APPCFG = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(&#x27;/usr/local/bin/appcfg.py&#x27;))
``
This should point to the location of the &quot;appcfg.py&quot; file that comes with the Google App Engine SDK. If you have the SDK you may want to change this config parameters to the correct value. It will allow you to deploy to GAE from the admin interface.

``DEMO_MODE``:inxx

You can also set web2py admin in demo mode:
``
DEMO_MODE = True
FILTER_APPS = [&#x27;welcome&#x27;]
``
And only the apps listed in filter apps will be accessible and they will be only accessible in read-only mode.

``MULTI_USER_MODE``:inxx
``virtual laboratory``:inxx

If you are a teacher and want to expose the administrative interface to students so that students can share one administrative interface for their projects (think of a virtual lab), can do it by setting:
``
MULTI_USER_MODE = True
``
In this way students will be required to login and will only be able to access their own apps via admin. You, as first user/teacher, will be able to access them all.

In multi user mode, you can register students using the &quot;bulk register&quot; link in admin and manage them using the &quot;manage students&quot; link. The system also keep track of when students login and how many lines of code add/remove to/from their code. This data is presented to the administrator as charts under the application &quot;about&quot; page.

Mind that this mechanism still assumes all users are trusted. All the apps created under admin run under the same credentials on the same filesystem. It is possible for an app created by a student to access the data and the source of an app created by another student. It is also possible for a student to create an app that locks the server.

#### Mobile **admin**

Notice that the admin application includes &quot;plugin_jqmodile&quot; which packages jQuery Mobile. When admin is accessed from a mobile devide, this is detected by web2py and the interface is displayed using a mobile friendly layout.

### More on **appadmin**

``appadmin``:inxx

**appadmin** is not intended to be exposed to the public. It is designed to help you by providing an easy access to the database. It consists of only two files: a controller &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and a view &quot;appadmin.html&quot; which are used by all actions in the controller.

The **appadmin** controller is relatively small and readable; it provides an example of designing a database interface.

**appadmin** shows which databases are available and which tables exist in each database. You can insert records and list all records for each table individually. **appadmin** paginates output 100 records at a time.

Once a set of records is selected, the header of the pages changes, allowing you to update or delete the selected records.

To update the records, enter an SQL assignment in the Query string field:
``
title = &#x27;test&#x27;
``:code

where string values must be enclosed in single quotes. Multiple fields can be separated by commas.

To delete a record, click the corresponding checkbox to confirm that you are sure.

**appadmin** can also perform joins if the SQL FILTER contains a SQL condition that involves two or more tables. For example, try:
``
db.image.id == db.comment.image_id
``:code

web2py passes this along to the DAL, and it understands that the query links two tables; hence, both tables are selected with an INNER JOIN. Here is the output:

[[image @///image/en5600.png center 480px]]

If you click on the number of an id field, you get an edit page for the record with the corresponding id.

If you click on the number of a reference field, you get an edit page for the referenced record.

You cannot update or delete rows selected by a join, because they involve records from multiple tables and this would be ambiguous.

In addition to its database administration capabilities, **appadmin** also enables you to view details about the contents of the application&#x27;s ``cache`` (at ``/yourapp/appadmin/ccache``) as well as the contents of the current ``request``, ``response``, and ``session`` objects (at ``/yourapp/appadmin/state``).

**appadmin** replaces ``response.menu`` with its own menu, which provides links to the application&#x27;s **edit** page in **admin**, the **db** (database administration) page, the **state** page, and the **cache** page. If your application&#x27;s layout does not generate a menu using ``response.menu``, then you will not see the **appadmin** menu. In that case, you can modify the appadmin.html file and add ``{{=MENU(response.menu)}}`` to display the menu.

``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide an example of the built-in web2py wiki.

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

------
Notice the API of the built-in wiki is still considered experimental and small changes are still possible.
------

Here we assume we are starting from scratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged-in as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is understood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You can make your own view for this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. There is no need to call the action &quot;index&quot;.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you to create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have URLs like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_create
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_search
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_could
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_recent
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_edit/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_editmedia/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_preview/...
``

Try to create more pages such as &quot;index&quot;, &quot;aboutus&quot;, and &quot;contactus&quot;.
Try to edit them.


The ``wiki`` method has the following signature:

``
def wiki(self, slug=None, env=None, render=&#x27;markmin&#x27;,
         manage_permissions=False, force_prefix=&#x27;&#x27;,
         restrict_search=False, resolve=True,
         extra=None, menugroups=None)
``:code

It takes the following arguments:

- ``render`` which defaults to ``&#x27;markmin&#x27;`` but can be set equal to ``&#x27;html&#x27;``. It determines the syntax of the wiki. We will discuss the markmin wiki markup later. If you change it to HTML you may want to use a wysiwyg javascript editor such as TinyMCE or NicEdit.
- ``manage_permissions``. This is set to ``False`` by default and only recognizes permissions for &quot;wiki-editor&quot; and &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you change it to ``True`` the create/edit page will give the option to specify by names the group(s) whose members have permission to read and edit the page. There is a group &quot;everybody&quot; which includes all users.

- ``force_prefix``. If set to something like ``&#x27;%(id)s-&#x27;`` it will restrict authors (not editors) to creating pages with a prefix like &quot;[user id]-[page name]&quot;. The prefix can contain the id (&quot;%(id)s&quot;) or the username (&quot;%(username)s&quot;) or any other field from the auth_user table, as long as the corresponding column contains valid string that would pass URL validation.
- ``restrict_search``. This defaults to ``False`` and any logged-in user can search all wiki pages (but not necessary read or edit them). If set to ``True``, authors can search only their own pages, editors can search everything, other users cannot search anything.
- ``menugroups``. This defaults to ``None`` and it indicates that wiki management menu (search, create, edit, etc.) is always displayed. You can set it to a list of group names whose members only can see this menu, for example ``[&#x27;wiki-editor&#x27;,&#x27;wiki-author&#x27;]``. Notice that even if the menu is exposed to everybody that does not mean everybody is allowed to perform actions listed in the menu since they are regulated by the access control system.

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide an example of the built-in web2py wiki.

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

------
Notice the API of the built-in wiki is still considered experimental and small changes are still possible.
------

Here we assume we are starting from scratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged-in as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is understood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You can make your own view for this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. There is no need to call the action &quot;index&quot;.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you to create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have URLs like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_create
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_search
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_could
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_recent
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_edit/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_editmedia/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_preview/...
``

Try creating more pages such as &quot;index&quot;, &quot;aboutus&quot;, and &quot;contactus&quot;.
Try editing them.


The ``wiki`` method has the following signature:

``
def wiki(self, slug=None, env=None, render=&#x27;markmin&#x27;,
         manage_permissions=False, force_prefix=&#x27;&#x27;,
         restrict_search=False, resolve=True,
         extra=None, menugroups=None)
``:code

It takes the following arguments:

- ``render`` which defaults to ``&#x27;markmin&#x27;`` but can be set equal to ``&#x27;html&#x27;``. It determines the syntax of the wiki. We will discuss the markmin wiki markup later. If you change it to HTML you may want to use a wysiwyg javascript editor such as TinyMCE or NicEdit.
- ``manage_permissions``. This is set to ``False`` by default and only recognizes permissions for &quot;wiki-editor&quot; and &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you change it to ``True`` the create/edit page will give the option to specify by names the group(s) whose members have permission to read and edit the page. In this case is a group &quot;everybody&quot; to give read permission to everybody.
- ``force_prefix``. If set to something like ``&#x27;%(id)s-&#x27;`` it will restrict authors (not editors) to creating pages with a prefix like &quot;[user id]-[page name]&quot;. The prefix can contain the id (&quot;%(id)s&quot;) or the username (&quot;%(username)s&quot;) or any other field from the auth_user table, as long as the corresponding column contains valid string that would pass URL validation.
- ``restrict_search``. This defaults to ``False`` and any logged-in user can search all wiki pages (but not necessary read or edit them). If set to ``True``, authors can search only their own pages, editors can search everything, other users cannot search anything.
- ``menugroups``. This defaults to ``None`` and it indicates that wiki management menu (search, create, edit, etc.) is always displayed. You can set it to a list of group names whose members only can see this menu, for example ``[&#x27;wiki-editor&#x27;,&#x27;wiki-author&#x27;]``. Notice that even if the menu is exposed to everybody that does not mean everybody is allowed to perform actions listed in the menu since they are regulated by the access control system.

------
Attention, to run web2py on Windows from source you must install first Mark Hammond&#x27;s [[Python for Windows extensions http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/]]
------

The web2py program accepts various command line options which are discussed later.

By default, at startup, web2py displays a startup window and then displays a GUI widget that asks you to choose a one-time administrator password, the IP address of the network interface to be used for the web server, and a port number from which to serve requests. By default, web2py runs its web server on 127.0.0.1:8000 (port 8000 on localhost), but you can run it on any available IP address and port. You can query the IP address of your network interface by opening a command line and typing ``ipconfig`` on Windows or ``ifconfig`` on OS X and Linux. From now on we assume web2py is running on localhost (127.0.0.1:8000). Use 0.0.0.0:80 to run web2py publicly on any of your network interfaces.

[[image @///image/en400.png center 306px]]

If you do not provide an administrator password, the administration interface is disabled. This is a security measure to prevent publicly exposing the admin interface.

The administrative interface, **admin**, is only accessible from localhost unless you run web2py behind Apache with mod_proxy. If **admin** detects a proxy, the session cookie is set to secure and **admin** login does not work unless the communication between the client and the proxy goes over HTTPS; this is a security measure. All communications between the client and **admin** must always be local or encrypted; otherwise an attacker would be able to perform a man-in-the middle attack or a replay attack and execute arbitrary code on the server.

After the administration password has been set, web2py starts up the web browser at the page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
``:code

If the computer does not have a default browser, open a web browser and enter the URL.

[[image @///image/en500.png center 480px]]

Clicking on &quot;administrative interface&quot; takes you to the login page for the administration interface.

[[image @///image/en600.png center 480px]]

The administrator password is the password you chose at startup.
Notice that there is only one administrator, and therefore only one administrator password. For security reasons, the developer is asked to choose a new password every time web2py starts unless the &lt;recycle&gt; option is specified. This is distinct from the authentication mechanism in web2py applications.

After the administrator logs into web2py, the browser is redirected to the &quot;site&quot; page.

[[image @///image/en700.png center 480px]]
Notice that ``counter`` is not a web2py keyword but ``session`` is. We are askin
A more compact way to code the same function is this:
``
def index():
    session.counter = (session.counter or 0) + 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
``:code

Now modify the view to add a line that displays the value of the counter:
``
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{=message}}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Number of visits: {{=counter}}&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
``:code

When you visit the index page again (and again) you should get the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1300.png center 480px]]

The counter is associated with each visitor, and is incremented each time the visitor reloads the page. Different visitors see different counters.


#### Say my name
``form``:inxx ``request.vars``:inxx

Now create two pages (first and second), where the first page creates a form, asks the visitor&#x27;s name, and redirects to the second page, which greets the visitor by name.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1400.png center 200px]]

Write the corresponding actions in the default controller:
``
def first():
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then create a view &quot;default/first.html&quot; for the first action,
and enter:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;form action=&quot;second&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

Finally, create a view &quot;default/second.html&quot; for the second action:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=request.vars.visitor_name}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

``layout``:inxx
In both views we have extended the basic &quot;layout.html&quot; view that comes with web2py. The layout view keeps the look and feel of the two pages coherent. The layout file can be edited and replaced easily, since it mainly contains HTML code.

If you now visit the first page, type your name:

[[image @///image/en1500.png center 480px]]

and submit the form, you will receive a greeting:

[[image @///image/en1600.png center 480px]]

#### Postbacks
``redirect``:inxx ``URL``:inxx ``postback``:inxx

The mechanism for form submission that we used before is very common, but it is not good programming practice. All input should be validated and, in the above example, the burden of validation would fall on the second action. Thus the action that performs the validation is different from the action that generated the form. This tends to cause redundancy in the code.

A better pattern for form submission is to submit forms to the same action that generated them, in our example the &quot;first&quot;. The &quot;first&quot; action should receive the variables, process them, store them server-side, and redirect the visitor to the &quot;second&quot; page, which retrieves the variables. This mechanism is called a &#x27;&#x27;postback&#x27;&#x27;.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1700.png center 200px]]

Modify the default controller to implement self-submission:
``
def first():
    if request.vars.visitor_name:
        session.visitor_name = request.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then modify the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
What is your name?
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

and the &quot;default/second.html&quot; view needs to retrieve the data from the ``session`` instead of from the ``request.vars``:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=session.visitor_name or &quot;anonymous&quot;}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

From the point of view of the visitor, the self-submission behaves exactly the same as the previous implementation. We have not added validation yet, but it is now clear that validation should be performed by the first action.
with associated &quot;views/default/manage.html&quot;
Using appadmin create a group &quot;manager&quot; and make some users members of the group. They will not be able to access

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/manage
``

and browse, search:

[[image @///image/en3200.png center 480px]]

create, update and delete images and their comments:

[[image @///image/en3300.png center 480px]]

#### Configuring the layout

You can configure the default layout by editing &quot;views/layout.html&quot; but you can also configure it without editing the HTML. In fact, the &quot;static/base.css&quot; stylesheet is well documented and described in Chapter 5. You can change color, columns, size, borders and background without editing the HTML. If you want to edit the menu, the title or the subtitle, you can do so in any model file. The scaffolding app, sets default values of these parameters in the file &quot;models/menu.py&quot;:

``
response.title = request.application
response.subtitle = &#x27;customize me!&#x27;
response.meta.author = &#x27;you&#x27;
response.meta.description = &#x27;describe your app&#x27;
response.meta.keywords = &#x27;bla bla bla&#x27;
response.menu = [ [ &#x27;Index&#x27;, False, URL(&#x27;index&#x27;) ] ]
``:code

### A simple wiki
``wiki``:inxx ``RSS``:inxx ``Ajax``:inxx ``XMLRPC``:inxx

In this section, we build a simple wiki from scratch using only low level APIs (as opposed to using the built-in wiki capabilities of web2py demonstrated in the next section). The visitor will be able to create pages, search them (by title), and edit them. The visitor will also be able to post comments (exactly as in the previous applications), and also post documents (as attachments to the pages) and link them from the pages. As a convention, we adopt the Markmin syntax for our wiki syntax. We will also implement a search page with Ajax, an RSS feed for the pages, and a handler to search the pages via XML-RPC``xmlrpc``:cite . The following diagram lists the actions that we need to implement and the links we intend to build among them.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en3400.png center 200px]]

Start by creating a new scaffolding app, naming it &quot;mywiki&quot;.

The model must contain three tables: page, comment, and document. Both comment and document reference page because they belong to page. A document contains a file field of type upload as in the previous images application.

Here is the complete model:
``
db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)

from gluon.tools import *
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
crud = Crud(db)

db.define_table(&#x27;page&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;title&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id))

db.define_table(&#x27;document&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;name&#x27;),
Python program.
        print item[&#x27;created_on&#x27;], item[&#x27;title&#x27;]
``:code

The handler can be accessed from many other programming languages that understand XML-RPC, including C, C++, C# and Java.

#### On ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time`` format

There are three different representation for each of the field types ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time``:
- the database representation
- the internal web2py prepresentation
- the string representation in forms and tables

The database representation is an internal issue and does not affect the code. Internally, at the web2py level, they are stored as ``datetime.date``, ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.time`` object respectively and they can be manipulated as such:

``
for page in db(db.page).select():
    print page.title, page.day, page.month, page.year
``

When dates are converted to strings in forms they are converted using the ISO representation 
``
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
``

yet this representation in internationalized and you can use the admin stranslation page to change the format to an alternate one. For example:

``
%m/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S
``

Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications is already written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need declare that the application current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide and example of the built-in web2py wiki. 

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

------
Notice the API of the built-in wiki are still considered experimental and small changes are still possible.
------

Here we assume we are starting from cratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is undesrtood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You man make your own view for the this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. There is no need to call the action &quot;index&quot;.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have RULS like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:
and the following action:
@auth.requires_login()
def manage_things():
    return SQLFORM.grid(db.thing)
``:code

This action is special because it returns a widget/helper not a dict of objects. Now we can embed this ``manage_things`` action into any view, with

``
{{=LOAD(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;manage_things&#x27;,ajax=True)}}
``:code

This allows the visitor interact with the component via Ajax without reloadin the host page that embeds the widget. Basically the action is called via Ajax, inherits the stile of the host page, and capture all forms submissions and flash messages so that thye are handled within the current page. On top of this the ``SQLFORM.grid`` widget uses digitally signed URLs to restrict access. More informaiton about components can be found in chapter 13.

Components like the one above can be embedded into wiki pages using the MARKMIN syntax:

``
@{component:default/manage_things}
``

This simply tells web2py that we want to incude the &quot;manage_things&quot; action defined in the &quot;default&quot; controller as an Ajax &quot;component&quot;.

---------
Most users will be able to build relatively complex applications simply by using ``auth.wiki`` to create pages and menus, and embedded custom components into wiki pages. Wiki can be tough as a mechanism to allow members of the group to create pages but they calso be though as a way to develop applications in a modular way.

This page lists all installed applications. There are two forms at the bottom.

The first of them allows creating a new application by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The second form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it. This can be its original name, but does not need to be. This allows installing multiple copies of the same application. You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or Instant Press CMS created by Martin Mulone:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or one of the many example applications available at:

``
http://web2py.com/appliances
``

------
Web2py files are packages as ``.w2p`` files. These ones are tar gzipped files. Web2py uses the ``.w2p`` extension instead of the ``.tgz`` extension to prevent the browser from unzipping on download. They can be uncompressed manually with ``tar zxvf [filename]`` although this is never necessary.
------

[[image @///image/en4100.png center 444px]]

Upon successful upload, web2py displays the MD5 checksum of the uploaded file. You can use it to verify that the file was not corrupted during upload. The InstantPress name will appear in the list of installed applications.

Click on the application name on admin to get it up and running.

If you run web2py from source and you have ``pyhton-git`` installed, you can install applications directly from git reporsitory using the ``.git`` URL in the upload form. In this case you will also be used to user the admin interface to push changes back into the repository.

For each application the &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page allows you to:
- Uninstall the application.
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Clean up temporary files (sessions, errors, and cache.disk files).
- Pack all. This returns a tar file containing a complete copy of the application. We suggest that you clean up temporary files before packing an application.
- Compile the application. If there are no errors, this option will bytecode-compile all models, controllers and views. Because views can extend and include other views in a tree, before bytecode compilation, the view tree for every controller is collapsed into a single file. The net effect is that a bytecode-compiled application is faster, because there is no more parsing of templates or string substitutions occurring at runtime.
- Pack compiled. This option is only present for bytecode-compiled applications. It allows packing the application without source code for distribution as closed source. Note that Python (as any other programming language) can technically be decompiled; therefore compilation does not provide complete protection of the source code. Nevertheless, decompilation can be difficult and can be illegal.
- Remove compiled. It simply removes the byte-code compiled models, views and controllers from the application. If the application was packaged with source code or edited locally, there is no harm in removing the bytecode-compiled files, and the application will continue to work. If the application was installed form a packed compiled file, then this is not safe, because there is no source code to revert to, and the application will no longer work.

``admin.py``:inxx

-------
All the functionality available from the web2py admin site page is also accessible programmatically via the API defined in the module ``gluon/admin.py``. Simply open a python shell and import this module.
-------

If the Google App Engine SDK is installer the admin &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page shows a button to push your applications to GAE. If ``python-git`` is installed, there is also a button to push your application to Open Shift. To install applications on ``heroku`` or other hosting system you should look into the &quot;scripts&quot; folder for the appropriate script.

#### About
``about``:inxx ``license``:inxx

The &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; tab allows editing the description of the application and its license. These are written respectively in the ABOUT and LICENSE files in the application folder.

[[image @///image/en4300.png center 480px]]

You can use ``MARKMIN``, or ``gluon.contrib.markdown.WIKI`` syntax for these files as described in ref.``markdown2``:cite .

#### Design
``EDIT``:inxx
You have used the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page already in this chapter. Here we want to point out a few more functionalities of the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page.
- If you click on any file name, you can see the contents of the file with syntax highlighting.
- If you click on edit, you can edit the file via a web interface.
- If you click on delete, you can delete the file (permanently).
- If you click on test, web2py will run tests. Tests are written by the developer using Python doctests, and each function should have its own tests.
- You can add language files, scan the app to discover all strings, and edit string translations via the web interface.
- If the static files are organized in folders and subfolders, the folder hierarchy can be toggled by clicking on a folder name.

The image below shows the output of the test page for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4400.png center 480px]]

The image below show the languages tab for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4500.png center 480px]]

The image below shows how to edit a language file, in this case the &quot;it&quot; (Italian) language for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4600.png center 480px]]

##### Intergated debugger

##### Shell

If you click on the &quot;shell&quot; link under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27;, web2py will open a web based Python shell and will execute the models for the current application. This allows you to interactively talk to your application.

[[image @///image/en4700.png center 480px]]

##### Crontab

Also under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; there is a &quot;crontab&quot; link. By clicking on this link you will be able to edit the web2py crontab file. This follows the same syntax as the unix crontab but does not rely on unix. In fact, it only requires web2py, and it works on Windows. It allows you to register actions that need to be executed in background at scheduled times.
For more information about this, see the next chapter.

#### Errors
``errors``:inxx

When programming web2py, you will inevitably make mistakes and introduce bugs. web2py helps in two ways: 1) it allows you to create tests for every function that can be run in the browser from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page; and 2) when an error manifests itself, a ticket is issued to the visitor and the error is logged.

Intentionally introduce an error in the images application as shown below:
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL,orderby=db.image.title)
    1/0
    return dict(images=images)
``:code

When you access the index action, you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en4800.png center 480px]]

Only the administrator can access the ticket:

[[image @///image/en4900.png center 480px]]

The ticket shows the traceback, and the content of the file that caused the problem, and the complete state of system (variables, request, session, etc.) If the error occurs in a view, web2py shows the view converted from HTML into Python code. This allows to easily identify the logical structure of the file.

By default tickets are stored on filesystem and group by traceback. The administrative interface provides an aggregate views (type of traceback and number of occurrence) and a detailed view (all tickets are listed by ticket id). The administrator can switch between the two views.

Notice that everywhere **admin** shows syntax-highlighted code (for example, in error reports, web2py keywords are shown in orange). If you click on a web2py keyword, you are redirected to a documentation page about the keyword.

If you fix the divide-by-zero bug in the index action and introduce one in the index view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}

&lt;h1&gt;Current Images&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{{for image in images:}}
{{1/0}}
{{=LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&quot;show&quot;, args=image.id)))}}
{{pass}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en5000.png center 480px]]

Note that web2py has converted the view from HTML into a Python file, and the error described in the ticket refers to the generated Python code and NOT to the original view file:

[[image @///image/en5100.png center 480px]]

This may seem confusing at first, but in practice it makes debugging easier, because the Python indentation highlights the logical structure of the code that you embedded in the views.

The code is shown at the bottom of the same page.

All tickets are listed under admin in the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page for each application:

[[image @///image/en5200.png center 480px]]

#### Mercurial
``Mercurial``:inxx

If you are running from source and you have the Mercurial version control libraries installed:
``
easy_install mercurial
``:code

then the administrative interface shows one more menu item called &quot;Versioning&quot;. It automatically creates a local Mercurial repository for the application. Pressing the &quot;commit&quot; button in the page will commit the current application. Mercurial creates and stores information about changes you make in your code into a hidden folder &quot;.hg&quot; in your app subfolder. Every app has its own &quot;.hg&quot; folder and its own &quot;.hgignore&quot; file (tells Mercurial which files to ignore).

The Mercurial web interface does allow you to browse previous commit and diff files but we do recommend you use Mercurial directly from the shell or one of the many GUI-based Mercurial clients since they are more powerful. For example they will allow you sync your app with a remote source repository:

[[images @///image/en5300.png center 480px]]


You can read more about Mercurial here:

#### Application Wizard (experimental)
</pre></div>
    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #F2DEDE;">On Windows, run:
``
web2py.exe
``:code

On OS X, run:
``
open web2py.app
``:code

On Unix and Linux, run from source by typing:
``
python2.5 web2py.py
``:code

To run web2py on Windows from source install first Mark Hammond&#x27;s [[Python for Windows extensions http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/]], then run:
``
python2.5 web2py.py
``:code


The web2py program accepts various command line options which are discussed later.

By default, at startup, web2py displays a startup window and then displays a GUI widget that asks you to choose a one-time administrator password, the IP address of the network interface to be used for the web server, and a port number from which to serve requests. By default, web2py runs its web server on 127.0.0.1:8000 (port 8000 on localhost), but you can run it on any available IP address and port. You can query the IP address of your network interface by opening a command line and typing ``ipconfig`` on Windows or ``ifconfig`` on OS X and Linux. From now on we assume web2py is running on localhost (127.0.0.1:8000). Use 0.0.0.0:80 to run web2py publicly on any of your network interfaces.

[[image @///image/en400.png center 306px]]

If you do not provide an administrator password, the administration interface is disabled. This is a security measure to prevent publicly exposing the admin interface.

The administrative interface, **admin**, is only accessible from localhost unless you run web2py behind Apache with mod_proxy. If **admin** detects a proxy, the session cookie is set to secure and **admin** login does not work unless the communication between the client and the proxy goes over HTTPS; this is a security measure. All communications between the client and **admin** must always be local or encrypted; otherwise an attacker would be able to perform a man-in-the middle attack or a replay attack and execute arbitrary code on the server.

After the administration password has been set, web2py starts up the web browser at the page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
``:code

If the computer does not have a default browser, open a web browser and enter the URL.

[[image @///image/en500.png center 480px]]

Clicking on &quot;administrative interface&quot; takes you to the login page for the administration interface.

[[image @///image/en600.png center 480px]]

The administrator password is the password you chose at startup.
Notice that there is only one administrator, and therefore only one administrator password. For security reasons, the developer is asked to choose a new password every time web2py starts unless the &lt;recycle&gt; option is specified. This is distinct from the authentication mechanism in web2py applications.

After the administrator logs into web2py, the browser is redirected to the &quot;site&quot; page.

[[image @///image/en700.png center 480px]]
Notice that ``counter`` is not a web2py keyword but ``session`` is. We are askin
A more compact way to code the same function is this:
``
def index():
    session.counter = (session.counter or 0) + 1
    return dict(message=&quot;Hello from MyApp&quot;, counter=session.counter)
``:code

Now modify the view to add a line that displays the value of the counter:
``
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{=message}}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Number of visits: {{=counter}}&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
``:code

When you visit the index page again (and again) you should get the following HTML page:

[[image @///image/en1300.png center 480px]]

The counter is associated with each visitor, and is incremented each time the visitor reloads the page. Different visitors see different counters.


#### Say my name
``form``:inxx ``request.vars``:inxx

Now create two pages (first and second), where the first page creates a form, asks the visitor&#x27;s name, and redirects to the second page, which greets the visitor by name.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1400.png center 293px]]

Write the corresponding actions in the default controller:
``
def first():
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then create a view &quot;default/first.html&quot; for the first action,
and enter:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;form action=&quot;second&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

Finally, create a view &quot;default/second.html&quot; for the second action:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=request.vars.visitor_name}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

``layout``:inxx
In both views we have extended the basic &quot;layout.html&quot; view that comes with web2py. The layout view keeps the look and feel of the two pages coherent. The layout file can be edited and replaced easily, since it mainly contains HTML code.

If you now visit the first page, type your name:

[[image @///image/en1500.png center 480px]]

and submit the form, you will receive a greeting:

[[image @///image/en1600.png center 480px]]

#### Postbacks
``redirect``:inxx ``URL``:inxx ``postback``:inxx

The mechanism for form submission that we used before is very common, but it is not good programming practice. All input should be validated and, in the above example, the burden of validation would fall on the second action. Thus the action that performs the validation is different from the action that generated the form. This tends to cause redundancy in the code.

A better pattern for form submission is to submit forms to the same action that generated them, in our example the &quot;first&quot;. The &quot;first&quot; action should receive the variables, process them, store them server-side, and redirect the visitor to the &quot;second&quot; page, which retrieves the variables. This mechanism is called a &#x27;&#x27;postback&#x27;&#x27;.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1700.png center 293px]]

Modify the default controller to implement self-submission:
``
def first():
    if request.vars.visitor_name:
        session.visitor_name = request.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then modify the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
What is your name?
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

and the &quot;default/second.html&quot; view needs to retrieve the data from the ``session`` instead of from the ``request.vars``:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=session.visitor_name or &quot;anonymous&quot;}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

From the point of view of the visitor, the self-submission behaves exactly the same as the previous implementation. We have not added validation yet, but it is now clear that validation should be performed by the first action.
with associated &quot;views/default/manage.html&quot;
Using appadmin create a group &quot;manager&quot; and make some users members of the group. They will not be able to access

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/manage
``

and browse, search:

[[image @///image/en3200.png center 480px]]

create, update and delete images and their comments:

[[image @///image/en3300.png center 480px]]

#### Configuring the layout

You can configure the default layout by editing &quot;views/layout.html&quot; but you can also configure it without editing the HTML. In fact, the &quot;static/base.css&quot; stylesheet is well documented and described in Chapter 5. You can change color, columns, size, borders and background without editing the HTML. If you want to edit the menu, the title or the subtitle, you can do so in any model file. The scaffolding app, sets default values of these parameters in the file &quot;models/menu.py&quot;:

``
response.title = request.application
response.subtitle = &#x27;customize me!&#x27;
response.meta.author = &#x27;you&#x27;
response.meta.description = &#x27;describe your app&#x27;
response.meta.keywords = &#x27;bla bla bla&#x27;
response.menu = [ [ &#x27;Index&#x27;, False, URL(&#x27;index&#x27;) ] ]
``:code

### A simple wiki
``wiki``:inxx ``RSS``:inxx ``Ajax``:inxx ``XMLRPC``:inxx

In this section, we build a simple wiki from scratch using only low level APIs (as opposed to using the built-in wiki capabilities of web2py demonstrated in the next section). The visitor will be able to create pages, search them (by title), and edit them. The visitor will also be able to post comments (exactly as in the previous applications), and also post documents (as attachments to the pages) and link them from the pages. As a convention, we adopt the Markmin syntax for our wiki syntax. We will also implement a search page with Ajax, an RSS feed for the pages, and a handler to search the pages via XML-RPC``xmlrpc``:cite .

The following diagram lists the actions that we need to implement and the links we intend to build among them.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en3400.png center 250px]]

Start by creating a new scaffolding app, naming it &quot;mywiki&quot;.

The model must contain three tables: page, comment, and document. Both comment and document reference page because they belong to page. A document contains a file field of type upload as in the previous images application.

Here is the complete model:
``
db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)

from gluon.tools import *
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
crud = Crud(db)

db.define_table(&#x27;page&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;title&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id))

db.define_table(&#x27;document&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;name&#x27;),
Python program.
        print item[&#x27;created_on&#x27;], item[&#x27;title&#x27;]
``:code

The handler can be accessed from many other programming languages that understand XML-RPC, including C, C++, C# and Java.

#### On ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time`` format

There are three different representation for each of the field types ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time``:
- the database representation
- the internal web2py prepresentation
- the string representation in forms and tables

The database representation is an internal issue and does not affect the code. Internally, at the web2py level, they are stored as ``datetime.date``, ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.time`` object respectively and they can be manipulated as such:

``
for page in db(db.page).select():
    print page.title, page.day, page.month, page.year
``

When dates are converted to strings in forms they are converted using the ISO representation 
``
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
``

yet this representation in internationalized and you can use the admin stranslation page to change the format to an alternate one. For example:

``
%m/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S
``

Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications is already written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need declare that the application current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide and example of the built-in web2py wiki.

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

Here we assume we are starting from cratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is undesrtood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You man make your own view for the this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. There is no need to call the action &quot;index&quot;.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have RULS like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:
and the following action:
@auth.requires_login()
def manage_things():
    return SQLFORM.grid(db.thing)
``:code

This action is special because it returns a widget/helper not a dict of objects. Now we can embed this ``manage_things`` action into any view, with

``
{{=LOAD(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;manage_things&#x27;,ajax=True)}}
``:code

This allows the visitor interact with the component via Ajax without reloadin the host page that embeds the widget. Basically the action is called via Ajax, inherits the stile of the host page, and capture all forms submissions and flash messages so that thye are handled within the current page. On top of this the ``SQLFORM.grid`` widget uses digitally signed URLs to restrict access. More informaiton about components can be found in chapter 13.

Components like the one above can be embedded into wiki pages using the MARKMIN syntax:

``
@{component:default/manage_things}
``

This simply tells web2py that we want to incude the &quot;manage_things&quot; action defined in the &quot;default&quot; controller as an Ajax &quot;component&quot;.

---------
Most users will be able to build relatively complex applications simply by using ``auth.wiki`` to create pages and menus, and embedded custom components into wiki pages. Wiki can be tough as a mechanism to allow members of the group to create pages but they calso be though as a way to develop applications in a modular way.
---------

### More on **admin**
``admin``:inxx

The administrative interface provides additional functionality that we briefly review here.

#### &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27;
``site``:inxx

This page lists all installed applications. There are two forms at the bottom.

The first of them allows creating a new application by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The second form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it. This can be its original name, but does not need to be. This allows installing multiple copies of the same application. You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or Instant Press CMS created by Martin Mulone:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or one of the many example applications available at:

``
http://web2py.com/appliances
``

------
Web2py files are packages as ``.w2p`` files. These ones are tar gzipped files. Web2py uses the ``.w2p`` extension instead of the ``.tgz`` extension to prevent the browser from unzipping on download. They can be uncompressed manually with ``tar zxvf [filename]`` although this is never necessary.
------

[[image @///image/en4100.png center 444px]]

Upon successful upload, web2py displays the MD5 checksum of the uploaded file. You can use it to verify that the file was not corrupted during upload. The InstantPress name will appear in the list of installed applications.

Click on the application name on admin to get it up and running.

If you run web2py from source and you have ``pyhton-git`` installed, you can install applications directly from git reporsitory using the ``.git`` URL in the upload form. In this case you will also be used to user the admin interface to push changes back into the repository.

For each application the &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page allows you to:
- Uninstall the application.
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Clean up temporary files (sessions, errors, and cache.disk files).
- Pack all. This returns a tar file containing a complete copy of the application. We suggest that you clean up temporary files before packing an application.
- Compile the application. If there are no errors, this option will bytecode-compile all models, controllers and views. Because views can extend and include other views in a tree, before bytecode compilation, the view tree for every controller is collapsed into a single file. The net effect is that a bytecode-compiled application is faster, because there is no more parsing of templates or string substitutions occurring at runtime.
- Pack compiled. This option is only present for bytecode-compiled applications. It allows packing the application without source code for distribution as closed source. Note that Python (as any other programming language) can technically be decompiled; therefore compilation does not provide complete protection of the source code. Nevertheless, decompilation can be difficult and can be illegal.
- Remove compiled. It simply removes the byte-code compiled models, views and controllers from the application. If the application was packaged with source code or edited locally, there is no harm in removing the bytecode-compiled files, and the application will continue to work. If the application was installed form a packed compiled file, then this is not safe, because there is no source code to revert to, and the application will no longer work.

``admin.py``:inxx

-------
All the functionality available from the web2py admin site page is also accessible programmatically via the API defined in the module ``gluon/admin.py``. Simply open a python shell and import this module.
-------

If the Google App Engine SDK is installer the admin &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page shows a button to push your applications to GAE. If ``python-git`` is installed, there is also a button to push your application to Open Shift. To install applications on ``heroku`` or other hosting system you should look into the &quot;scripts&quot; folder for the appropriate script.

#### &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27;
``about``:inxx ``license``:inxx

The &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; tab allows editing the description of the application and its license. These are written respectively in the ABOUT and LICENSE files in the application folder.

[[image @///image/en4300.png center 480px]]

You can use ``MARKMIN``, or ``gluon.contrib.markdown.WIKI`` syntax for these files as described in ref.``markdown2``:cite .

#### &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27;
``EDIT``:inxx
You have used the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page already in this chapter. Here we want to point out a few more functionalities of the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page.
- If you click on any file name, you can see the contents of the file with syntax highlighting.
- If you click on edit, you can edit the file via a web interface.
- If you click on delete, you can delete the file (permanently).
- If you click on test, web2py will run tests. Tests are written by the developer using Python doctests, and each function should have its own tests.
- You can add language files, scan the app to discover all strings, and edit string translations via the web interface.
- If the static files are organized in folders and subfolders, the folder hierarchy can be toggled by clicking on a folder name.

The image below shows the output of the test page for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4400.png center 480px]]

The image below show the languages tab for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4500.png center 480px]]

The image below shows how to edit a language file, in this case the &quot;it&quot; (Italian) language for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4600.png center 480px]]

##### &#x27;&#x27;shell&#x27;&#x27;

If you click on the &quot;shell&quot; link under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27;, web2py will open a web based Python shell and will execute the models for the current application. This allows you to interactively talk to your application.

[[image @///image/en4700.png center 480px]]

##### &#x27;&#x27;crontab&#x27;&#x27;

Also under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; there is a &quot;crontab&quot; link. By clicking on this link you will be able to edit the web2py crontab file. This follows the same syntax as the unix crontab but does not rely on unix. In fact, it only requires web2py, and it works on Windows. It allows you to register actions that need to be executed in background at scheduled times.
For more information about this, see the next chapter.

#### &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27;
``errors``:inxx
When programming web2py, you will inevitably make mistakes and introduce bugs. web2py helps in two ways: 1) it allows you to create tests for every function that can be run in the browser from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page; and 2) when an error manifests itself, a ticket is issued to the visitor and the error is logged.

Intentionally introduce an error in the images application as shown below:
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL,orderby=db.image.title)
    1/0
    return dict(images=images)
``:code

When you access the index action, you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en4800.png center 480px]]

Only the administrator can access the ticket:

[[image @///image/en4900.png center 480px]]

The ticket shows the traceback, and the content of the file that caused the problem, and the complete state of system (variables, request, session, etc.) If the error occurs in a view, web2py shows the view converted from HTML into Python code. This allows to easily identify the logical structure of the file.

By default tickets are stored on filesystem and group by traceback. The administrative interface provides an aggregate views (type of traceback and number of occurrence) and a detailed view (all tickets are listed by ticket id). The administrator can switch between the two views.

Notice that everywhere **admin** shows syntax-highlighted code (for example, in error reports, web2py keywords are shown in orange). If you click on a web2py keyword, you are redirected to a documentation page about the keyword.

If you fix the divide-by-zero bug in the index action and introduce one in the index view:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}

&lt;h1&gt;Current Images&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{{for image in images:}}
{{1/0}}
{{=LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&quot;show&quot;, args=image.id)))}}
{{pass}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en5000.png center 480px]]

Note that web2py has converted the view from HTML into a Python file, and the error described in the ticket refers to the generated Python code and NOT to the original view file:

[[image @///image/en5100.png center 480px]]

This may seem confusing at first, but in practice it makes debugging easier, because the Python indentation highlights the logical structure of the code that you embedded in the views.

The code is shown at the bottom of the same page.

All tickets are listed under admin in the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page for each application:

[[image @///image/en5200.png center 480px]]

#### &#x27;&#x27;Mercurial&#x27;&#x27;
``Mercurial``:inxx

If you are running from source and you have the Mercurial version control libraries installed:
``
easy_install mercurial
``:code

then the administrative interface shows one more menu item called &quot;Versioning&quot;. It automatically creates a local Mercurial repository for the application. Pressing the &quot;commit&quot; button in the page will commit the current application. Mercurial creates and stores information about changes you make in your code into a hidden folder &quot;.hg&quot; in your app subfolder. Every app has its own &quot;.hg&quot; folder and its own &quot;.hgignore&quot; file (tells Mercurial which files to ignore).

The Mercurial web interface does allow you to browse previous commit and diff files but we do recommend you use Mercurial directly from the shell or one of the many GUI-based Mercurial clients since they are more powerful. For example they will allow you sync your app with a remote source repository:

#### Admin wizard (experimental)

The **admin** interface includes a Wizard that can help you create a new applications.
You can access the wizard from the &quot;sites&quot; page as shown in the image below.

[[image @///image/en5400.png center 480px]]

The wizard will guide you through a series of steps involved in creating a new application:

- Chose a name for the application
- Configure the application and choose required plugins
- Build required models (it will create CRUD pages for each model)
- Allow you to edit the views of those pages using MARKMIN syntax

The image below shows the second step of the process.

[[image @///image/en5500.png center 480px]]

You can see a dropdown to select a layout plugin (from ``web2py.com/layouts``), a multiple choice dropdown to check other plugins (from ``web2py.com/plugins``) and a &quot;login config&quot; field where to put the Janrain &quot;domain:key&quot;.

The other steps are pretty much self-explanatory.

The Wizard works well for what it does but it is considered an &#x27;&#x27;experimental feature&#x27;&#x27; for two reasons:

- Applications created with the wizard and edited manually, cannot later be modified by the wizard.
- The interface of the wizard will change over time to include support for more features and easier visual development.

In any case the wizard is a handy tool for fast prototyping and it can be used to bootstrap a new application with an alternate layout and optional plugins.

#### Configuring **admin**

Normally there is no need to perform any configuration of admin but a few customizations are possible. After you login into admin you can edit the admin configuration file via the URL:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/edit/admin/models/0.py
``
Notice that **admin** can be used to edit itself. In fact **admin** is an app as any other one.

The file &quot;0.py&quot; is very much self documented and if you are opening probably you already know what you are looking for. Anyway few customizations exist that are more important than others:

In the next section we will show how forms can be generated automatically from a model.

In all or examples we have used the session to pass the user name from the first action to the second. We could have used a different mechanism and pass data as part of a redirect URL:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;,vars=dict(name=name)))
    return dict(form=form)

def second():
    name = request.vars.visitor_name or redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
    return dict(name=name)
``:code

#### Internationalization

You code is likely to include hardcoded strings such as &quot;What is your name?&quot;. You should be able to customize strings without editing the code and in particular insert translations for these strings in different languages. In this way if a visitor has the language preference of the browser set to &quot;Italian&quot;, web2py will use the Italian translation for the strings, if available. This feature of web2py is called &quot;internationalization&quot; and it is described in more detail in the next chapter.

Here we just observe that in order to use this feature you should markup strings that needs translation. This is done by wrapping a a quoted string in code such as

``
&quot;What is your name?&quot;
``:code

with the ``T`` operator:

``
T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)
``:code


You can also mark fo translations strings hardcoded in views. For example

``
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

becomes

``
&lt;h1&gt;{{=T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

It is good practice to do this for every string in the code (field labels, flash messages, etc.) except for tables and field names.

Once the strings are identified and marked up, web2py takes care of almost everything else. The admin interface also provides a page where you can translate each string in the languages you desire to support.

### An image blog
``upload``:inxx

Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments (posts).

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;post&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
The database representation is an internal issue and does not affect the code. I
for page in db(db.page).select():
    print page.title, page.day, page.month, page.year
``

When dates are converted to strings in forms they are converted using the ISO representation
``
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
``

yet this representation in internationalized and you can use the admin stranslation page to change the format to an alternate one. For example:

``
%m/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S
``

Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications is already written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need declare that the application current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide and example of the built-in web2py wiki.

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

------
Notice the API of the built-in wiki are still considered experimental and small changes are still possible.
------

Here we assume we are starting from scratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is understood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You man make your own view for this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. There is no need to call the action &quot;index&quot;.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have RULS like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_create
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_search
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_could
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_recent
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_edit/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_editmedia/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_preview/...
``

Try create more pages such as &quot;index&quot;, &quot;aboutus&quot;, and &quot;contactus&quot;.
Try edit them.


The ``wiki`` method has the following signature:

``
def wiki(self, slug=None, env=None, render=&#x27;markmin&#x27;,
         manage_permissions=False, force_prefix=&#x27;&#x27;,
         restrict_search=False, resolve=True,
         extra=None, menugroups=None)
``:code

It takes the following arguments:

- ``render`` which defaults to ``&#x27;markmin&#x27;`` but can be set equal to ``&#x27;html&#x27;``. It termines the syntax of the wiki. We will discuss the markmin wiki markup later. If you change it to HTML you may want to use a wysiwyg javascript editor such as TinyMCE of NicEdit.
- ``manage_permissions``. This is set to ``False`` by default and only recognizes permissions for &quot;wiki-editor&quot; and &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you change it to ``True`` the create/edit page will give the option to specify by names the groups whose members have permission to read and edit the page. In this case is a group &quot;everybody&quot; to give read permission to everybody.
- ``force_prefix``. If set to something like ``&#x27;%(id)s-&#x27;`` it will restrict authors (not editors) to create page with a prefix like &quot;[user id]-[page name]&quot;. The prefix can contain the id (&quot;%(id)s&quot;) or the username (&quot;%(username)s&quot;) or any other field from the auth_user table, as long as the corresponding column contains valid string that would pass URL validation.
- ``restrict_search``. This default to ``False`` and any logged-in user can search all wiki pages (but not necessary read or edit them). If set to ``True``, authors can search only their own pages, editors can search everything, other users cannot search anything.
- ``menugroups``. This defaults to ``None`` and it indicates that wiki management menu (search, create, edit, etc.) is always displayed. You can set it to a list of group names whose members only can see this menu, for example ``[&#x27;wiki-editor&#x27;,&#x27;wiki-author&#x27;]``. Notice that even if the menu is exposed to everybody does not mean everybody is allowed to perform actions listed in the menu since they are regulated by the access control system.

The ``wiki`` method has some additional parameters which will be explained later: ``slug``, ``env``, and ``extra``.



#### MARKMIN basics

The MARKMIN syntax allows you to markup **bold** text using ``**bold**``, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27; text with ``&#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;``, ``code`` text with ``\`\`code\`\```. Titles must be prefixed by a #, sections by ##, and sub-sections by ###. Use a minus(-) to prefix an un-ordered item and plus(+) to prefix an ordered item. URLs are automatically into links. For example:

``
# This is title
## this is a section title
### this is a subsection title

Text can be **bold**, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;, !`!!`!code!`!!`! etc.
Learn more at:

http://web2py.com
``:code


You can use the ``extra`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to pass extra rendering rules to the MARKMIN helper.

You can find more information about the MARKMIN syntax in chapter 5.

``auth.wiki`` is more powerful than the barebones MARKMIN helpers, supporting oembed and components.

You can use theS ``env`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to expose functions to your wiki.
For example:

``
auth.wiki(env=dict(join=lambda a,b,c:&quot;%s-%s-%s&quot; % (a,b,c)))
``

allows you to use the markup syntax:

``
@(join:1,2,3)
``


This call the join function passed as extra with parameters ``a,b,c=1,2,3`` and will be rendered as ``1-2-3``.

#### Oembed protocol

You can type in (or cut-and-paste) any URL into a wiki page it normally is rendered as a link to the URL. There are exceptions:

- If the URL has an image extension, the link is embedded as an image, ``&lt;img/&gt;``.
- If the URL has an audio extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 audio ``&lt;audio/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a video extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 video ``&lt;video/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a MS Office or PDF extension, Google Doc Viewer is embedded, showing the content of the document (only works for public documents).
- If the URL points to a Youtube page, a Vimeo page, or a Flickr page, web2py contacts the corresponding web service and queries it about the proper way to embed the content. This is done using the ``oembed`` protocol.

Here is a complete list of supported formats:
``
Image (.PNG, .GIF, .JPG, .JPEG)
Audio (.WAV, .OGG, .MP3)
Video (.MOV, .MPE, .MP4, .MPG, .MPG2, .MPEG, .MPEG4, .MOVIE)
``

Supported via Google Doc Viewer:

``
Microsoft Excel (.XLS and .XLSX)
Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 / 2010 (.PPTX)
Apple Pages (.PAGES)
Adobe PDF (.PDF)
Adobe Illustrator (.AI)
Adobe Photoshop (.PSD)
Autodesk AutoCad (.DXF)
Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG)
PostScript (.EPS, .PS)
TrueType (.TTF)
xml Paper Specification (.XPS)
``:code

Supported by oembed:

``
flickr.com
youtube.com
hulu.com
vimeo.com
slideshare.net
qik.com
polleverywhere.com
wordpress.com
revision3.com
viddler.com
``:code

This is implemented in the web2py file ``gluon.contrib.autolinks`` and specifically in the function ``expand_one``. You can extend oembed support by registering more services. This is done by appending an entry to the ``EMBED_MAPS`` list:

``
from gluon.contrib.autolinks import EMBED_MAPS
EMBED_MAPS.append((re.compile(&#x27;http://vimeo.com/\S*&#x27;),
                   &#x27;http://vimeo.com/api/oembed.json&#x27;))
``:code

#### Referencing wiki content

If you create a wiki page with slug &quot;contactus&quot; you can refer to this page as

``
\@////contactus
``:code

Here ``\@////`` stands for

``
\@/app/controller/function/
``:code

but &quot;app&quot;, &quot;controller&quot;, and &quot;function&quot; are omitted thus assuming default.

Similarly you can use the wiki menu to upload a media file (for example an image) linked to the page. The &quot;manage media&quot; page will show all files you have uploaded and will show the proper expression to link the media file. If, for example you upload a file &quot;test.jpg&quot; with title &quot;beach&quot;, the link expression will something like:

``
\@////15/beach.jpg
``:code

``\@////`` is the same prefix described before. ``15`` is the id of the record storing the media file. ``beach`` is the title. ``.jpg`` is the extension of the original file.

If you cut and paste ``\@////15/beach.jpg`` into wiki pages you embed the image.

Mind that media files are linked to pages and inherit access permission from the pages.

#### Wiki menus

If you create a page with slug &quot;wiki-menu&quot; page it will be interpreted as a description of the menu. Here is an example:

``
- Home &gt; \@////index
- Info &gt; \@////info
- web2py &gt; http://google.com
- - About us &gt; \@////aboutus
- - Contact us &gt; \@////contactus
``

Each line a menu item. We used double dash for nested menu items. The ``&gt;`` symbols separates the menu item title from the menu item link.

Mind that the menu is appended to ``response.menu``. It does not replace it. The ``[wiki]`` menu tem with service functions is added automatically.

#### Service functions

If, for example, you want to use the wiki to create an editable sidebar you could create a page with ``slug=&quot;sidebar&quot;`` and then embed it in your layout.html with

``
{{=auth.wiki(slug=&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)}}
``:code

Notice that there is nothing special with the word &quot;sidebar&quot;. Any wiki page can be retrieved and embedded in any point in your code. This allows you mix and match wiki functionalities with regular web2py functionalities.

You can also embed special wiki functions as the search by tags:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_search&#x27;)}}
``:code

or the tag cloud:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_cloud&#x27;)}}
``:code

#### Components

One of the most powerful function of the new web2py consists in the ability of embedding an action inside another action. We call this a component.

Consider the following model:

``
db.define_table(&#x27;thing&#x27;,Field(&#x27;name&#x27;,requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
``:code

and the following action:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage_things():
    return SQLFORM.grid(db.thing)
``:code

This action is special because it returns a widget/helper not a dict of objects. Now we can embed this ``manage_things`` action into any view, with

``
{{=LOAD(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;manage_things&#x27;,ajax=True)}}
``:code

This allows the visitor interact with the component via Ajax without reloading the host page that embeds the widget. Basically the action is called via Ajax, inherits the stile of the host page, and capture all forms submissions and flash messages so that they are handled within the current page. On top of this the ``SQLFORM.grid`` widget uses digitally signed URLs to restrict access. More information about components can be found in chapter 13.

Components like the one above can be embedded into wiki pages using the MARKMIN syntax:

``
@{component:default/manage_things}
``

This simply tells web2py that we want to incude the &quot;manage_things&quot; action defined in the &quot;default&quot; controller as an Ajax &quot;component&quot;.

---------
Most users will be able to build relatively complex applications simply by using ``auth.wiki`` to create pages and menus and embedded custom components into wiki pages. Wikis can be thought of as a mechanism to allow members of the group to create pages, but they can also be thought of as a way to develop applications in a modular way.
---------

### More on **admin**
``admin``:inxx

The administrative interface provides additional functionality that we briefly review here.

#### Site
``site``:inxx

This page lists all installed applications. There are two forms at the bottom.

The first of them allows creating a new application by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The second form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it. This can be its original name, but does not need to be. This allows installing multiple copies of the same application. You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or Instant Press CMS created by Martin Mulone:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or one of the many example applications available at:

``
http://web2py.com/appliances
``

------
Web2py files are packages as ``.w2p`` files. These ones are tar gzipped files. Web2py uses the ``.w2p`` extension instead of the ``.tgz`` extension to prevent the browser from unzipping on download. They can be uncompressed manually with ``tar zxvf [filename]`` although this is never necessary.
------

[[image @///image/en4100.png center 444px]]

Upon successful upload, web2py displays the MD5 checksum of the uploaded file. You can use it to verify that the file was not corrupted during upload. The InstantPress name will appear in the list of installed applications.

Click on the application name on admin to get it up and running.

If you run web2py from source and you have ``python-git`` installed, you can install applications directly from git repository using the ``.git`` URL in the upload form. In this case you will also be used to user the admin interface to push changes back into the repository.

For each application the &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page allows you to:
- Uninstall the application.
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Clean up temporary files (sessions, errors, and cache.disk files).
- Pack all. This returns a tar file containing a complete copy of the application. We suggest that you clean up temporary files before packing an application.
- Compile the application. If there are no errors, this option will bytecode-compile all models, controllers and views. Because views can extend and include other views in a tree, before bytecode compilation, the view tree for every controller is collapsed into a single file. The net effect is that a bytecode-compiled application is faster, because there is no more parsing of templates or string substitutions occurring at runtime.
- Pack compiled. This option is only present for bytecode-compiled applications. It allows packing the application without source code for distribution as closed source. Note that Python (as any other programming language) can technically be decompiled; therefore compilation does not provide complete protection of the source code. Nevertheless, decompilation can be difficult and can be illegal.
- Remove compiled. It simply removes the byte-code compiled models, views and controllers from the application. If the application was packaged with source code or edited locally, there is no harm in removing the bytecode-compiled files, and the application will continue to work. If the application was installed form a packed compiled file, then this is not safe, because there is no source code to revert to, and the application will no longer work.

``admin.py``:inxx

-------
All the functionality available from the web2py admin site page is also accessible programmatically via the API defined in the module ``gluon/admin.py``. Simply open a python shell and import this module.
-------

If the Google App Engine SDK is installer the admin &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page shows a button to push your applications to GAE. If ``python-git`` is installed, there is also a button to push your application to Open Shift. To install applications on ``Heroku`` or other hosting system you should look into the &quot;scripts&quot; folder for the appropriate script.

#### About
``about``:inxx ``license``:inxx

The &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; tab allows editing the description of the application and its license. These are written respectively in the ABOUT and LICENSE files in the application folder.

[[image @///image/en4300.png center 480px]]

You can use ``MARKMIN``, or ``gluon.contrib.markdown.WIKI`` syntax for these files as described in ref.``markdown2``:cite .

#### Design
``EDIT``:inxx
You have used the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page already in this chapter. Here we want to point out a few more functionalities of the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page.
- If you click on any file name, you can see the contents of the file with syntax highlighting.
- If you click on edit, you can edit the file via a web interface.
- If you click on delete, you can delete the file (permanently).
- If you click on test, web2py will run tests. Tests are written by the developer using Python doctests, and each function should have its own tests.
- You can add language files, scan the app to discover all strings, and edit string translations via the web interface.
- If the static files are organized in folders and subfolders, the folder hierarchy can be toggled by clicking on a folder name.

The image below shows the output of the test page for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4400.png center 480px]]

The image below show the languages tab for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4500.png center 480px]]

The image below shows how to edit a language file, in this case the &quot;it&quot; (Italian) language for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4600.png center 480px]]

##### Integrated debugger

&#x27;&#x27;(requires Python 2.6 or later)&#x27;&#x27;

The web2py admin includes a web based debugger. Using the provided web-based editor you can add breakpoints to the Python code and, from the associated debugger console, you can inspect the system variables at those breakpoints and resume execution. This is illustrated in the following screenshot:

[[image @///image/debugger.png center 480px]]

This functionality is based on the Qdb debugger created by Mariano Reingart.
It uses multiprocessing.connection to communicate between the backend
and frontend, with a JSON-RPC-like stream protocol. ``qdb``:cite

##### Shell

If you click on the &quot;shell&quot; link under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27;, web2py will open a web based Python shell and will execute the models for the current application. This allows you to interactively talk to your application.

[[image @///image/en4700.png center 480px]]

##### Crontab

Also under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; there is a &quot;crontab&quot; link. By clicking on this link you will be able to edit the web2py crontab file. This follows the same syntax as the unix crontab but does not rely on unix. In fact, it only requires web2py, and it works on Windows. It allows you to register actions that need to be executed in background at scheduled times.
For more information about this, see the next chapter.

#### Errors
``errors``:inxx

When programming web2py, you will inevitably make mistakes and introduce bugs. web2py helps in two ways: 1) it allows you to create tests for every function that can be run in the browser from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page; and 2) when an error manifests itself, a ticket is issued to the visitor and the error is logged.

Intentionally introduce an error in the images application as shown below:
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL,orderby=db.image.title)
    1/0
    return dict(images=images)
``:code

When you access the index action, you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en4800.png center 480px]]

Only the administrator can access the ticket:
The file &quot;0.py&quot; is very much self documented and if you are opening probably you

``
GAE_APPCFG = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(&#x27;/usr/local/bin/appcfg.py&#x27;))
``
This should point to the location of the &quot;appcfg.py&quot; file that comes with the Google App Engine SDK. If you have the SDK you may want to change this config parameters to the correct value. It will allow you to deploy to GAE from the admin interface.

``DEMO_MODE``:inxx

You can also set web2py admin in demo mode:
``
DEMO_MODE = True
FILTER_APPS = [&#x27;welcome&#x27;]
``
And only the apps listed in filter apps will be accessible and they will be only accessible in read-only mode.

``MULTI_USER_MODE``:inxx
``virtual laboratory``:inxx

If you are a teacher and want to expose the administrative interface to students so that students can share one administrative interface for their projects (think of a virtual lab), can do it by setting:
``
MULTI_USER_MODE = True
``
In this way students will be required to login and will only be able to access their own apps via admin. You, as first user/teacher, will be able to access them all.

In multi user mode, you can register students using the &quot;bulk register&quot; link in admin and manage them using the &quot;manage students&quot; link. The system also keep track of when students login and how many lines of code add/remove to/from their code. This data is presented to the administrator as charts under the application &quot;about&quot; page.

Mind that this mechanism still assumes all users are trusted. All the apps created under admin run under the same credentials on the same filesystem. It is possible for an app created by a student to access the data and the source of an app created by another student. It is also possible for a student to create an app that locks the server.

#### Mobile **admin**

Notice that the admin application includes &quot;plugin_jqmodile&quot; which packages jQuery Mobile. When admin is accessed from a mobile device; this is detected by web2py and the interface is displayed using a mobile-friendly layout.
</pre></div>
    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #F2DEDE;">``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;,
                                 label=&#x27;what is yout name?&#x27;,
                                 requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

The ``form`` object can be easily serialized in HTML by embedding it in the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view.
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=form}}
``:code

The ``form.process()`` method applies the validators and returns the form itself. The ``form.accepted`` variable is set to True if the form was processed and passed validation. If the self-submitted form passes validation, it stores the variables in the session and redirects as before. If the form does not pass validation, error messages are inserted into the form and shown to the user, as below:

[[image @///image/en1800.png center 480px]]

In the next section we will show how forms can be generated automatically from a model.

In all or examples we have used the session to pass the user name from the first action to the second. We could have used a different mechanism and pass data as part of a redirect URL:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;,vars=dict(name=name)))
    return dict(form=form)

def second():
    name = request.vars.visitor_name or redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
    return dict(name=name)
``:code

#### Internationalization

You code is likely to include hardcoded strings such as &quot;What is your name?&quot;. You should be able to customize strings without editing the code and in particular insert translations for these strings in different languages. In this wasy if a visitor has the language preference of the browser set to &quot;Italian&quot;, web2py will use the Italian translation for the strings, if available. This feature of web2py is called &quot;internationalization&quot; and it is described in more detail in the next chapter.

Here we just observe that in order to use this feature you should markup strings that need stranslation. This is done by wrapping a a quoted string in code such as

``
&quot;What is your name?&quot;
``:code

with the ``T`` operator:

``
T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)
``:code


You can also mark fo translations strings hardcoded in views. For example

``
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

becomes

``
&lt;h1&gt;{{=T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

It is good practice to do this for every string in the code (field labels, flash messages, etc.) except for tables and field names.

Once the strings are indentified and marked up, web2py takes care of almost evrything else. The admin interface also provides a page where you can translate each string in the languages you desire to support.

### An image blog
``upload``:inxx

Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments (posts).

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;post&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
The database representation is an internal issue and does not affect the code. I
for page in db(db.page).select():
    print page.title, page.day, page.month, page.year
``

When dates are converted to strings in forms they are converted using the ISO representation
``
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
``

yet this representation in internationalized and you can use the admin stranslation page to change the format to an alternate one. For example:

``
%m/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S
``

Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications is already written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need declare that the application current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``

### The built-in web2py wiki

Now you can forget the code we have built-in the previous section (not what you have learned about web2py APIs, just the code of the specific example) as we are going to provide and example of the built-in web2py wiki.

In fact, web2py comes with wiki capabilities including media attachments, tags, tag cloud, page permissions, and support for oembed ``oembed``:cite and components (chapter 14). This wiki can be used with any web2py application.

------
Notice the API of the built-in wiki are still considered experimental and small changes are still possible.
------

Here we assume we are starting from cratch from a simple clone of the &quot;welcome&quot; application called &quot;wikidemo&quot;. Edit the controller and replace the &quot;index&quot; action with

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

Done! You have a fully working wiki. At this point no page has been created and in order to create pages you must be logged-in and you must be member of a group called &quot;wiki-editor&quot; or &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you are logged as administrator the &quot;wiki-editor&quot; group is created automatically and you are made a member. The difference between editors and authors is that the editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the pages they have created.

The ``auth.wiki()`` function returns in a dictionary with a key ``content`` which is understood by the scaffolding &quot;views/default/index.html&quot;. You man make your own view for this action:

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=content}}
``:code

and add extra HTML or code as needed. There is no need to call the action &quot;index&quot;.

To try the wiki, simply login into admin, visit the page

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index
``

Then choose a slug (in the publishing business, a slug is a short name given to an article that is in production) and you will be redirected to an empty page where you can edit the content using MARKMIN wiki syntax. A new menu item called &quot;[wiki]&quot; will allow you create, search, and edit pages. Wiki pages have RULS like:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/[slug]
``

Service pages have names which start by underscore:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_create
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_search
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_could
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_recent
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_edit/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_editmedia/...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wikidemo/default/index/_preview/...
``

Try create more pages such as &quot;index&quot;, &quot;aboutus&quot;, and &quot;contactus&quot;.
Try edit them.


The ``wiki`` method has the following signature:

``
def wiki(self, slug=None, env=None, render=&#x27;markmin&#x27;,
         manage_permissions=False, force_prefix=&#x27;&#x27;,
         restrict_search=False, resolve=True,
         extra=None, menugroups=None)
``:code

It takes the following arguments:

- ``render`` which defaults to ``&#x27;markmin&#x27;`` but can be set equal to ``&#x27;html&#x27;``. It termines the syntax of the wiki. We will discuss the makrmin wiki markup later. If you change it to HTML you may want to use a wysiwyg javascript editor such as TinyMCE of NicEdit.
- ``manage_permissions``. This is set to ``False`` by default and only recognizes permissions for &quot;wiki-editor&quot; and &quot;wiki-author&quot;. If you change it to ``True`` the create/edit page will give the option to specify by names the groups whose members have permssion to read and edit the page. In this case is a group &quot;everybody&quot; to give read permission to everybody.
- ``force_prefix``. If set to something like ``&#x27;%(id)s-&#x27;`` it will restict authors (not editors) to create page with a prefix like &quot;[user id]-[page name]&quot;. The prefix can contain the id (&quot;%(id)s&quot;) or the username (&quot;%(username)s&quot;) or any other field from the auth_user table, as long as the corresponding column contains valid string that would pass URL validation.
- ``restrict_search``. This default to ``False`` and any logged-in user can search all wiki pages (but not necessary read or edit them). If set to ``True``, authors can search only their own pages, editors can search everything, other users cannot search anything.
- ``menugroups``. This defaults to ``None`` and it indictates that wiki management menu (search, create, edit, etc.) is always displayed. You can set it to a list of group names whose members only can see this menu, for exmaple ``[&#x27;wiki-editor&#x27;,&#x27;wiki-author&#x27;]``. Notice that even if the menu is exposed to everybody does not mean everybody is allowed to perform actions listed in the menu since they are regulated by the access control system.

The ``wiki`` method has some additional parameters which will be explained later: ``slug``, ``env``, and ``extra``.



#### MARKMIN basics

The MARKMIN syntax allows you to markup **bold** text using ``**bold**``, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27; text with ``&#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;``, ``code`` text with ``\`\`code\`\```. Titles must be prefixed by a #, sections by ##, and sub-sections by ###. Use a minus(-) to prefix an un-ordered item and plus(+) to prefix an ordered item. URLs are automatically into links. For example:

``
# This is title
## this is a section title
### this is a subsection title

Text can be **bold**, &#x27;&#x27;italic&#x27;&#x27;, !`!!`!code!`!!`! etc.
Learn more at:

http://web2py.com
``:code


You can use the ``extra`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to pass extra rendering rules to the MARKMIN helper.

You can find more information about the MARKMIN syntax in chapter 5.

``auth.wiki`` is more powerful than the barebone MARKMIN helpers. In fact it supports oembed and components.

You can use theS ``env`` parameter of ``auth.wiki`` to expose functions to your wiki.
For example:

``
auth.wiki(env=dict(join=lambda a,b,c:&quot;%s-%s-%s&quot; % (a,b,c)))
``

allows you to use the markup syntax:

``
@(join:1,2,3)
``


This call the join function passed as extra with parameters ``a,b,c=1,2,3`` and will be redered as ``1-2-3``.

#### Oembed protocol

You can type in (or cut-and-paste) any URL into a wiki page it normally is rendered as a link to the URL. There are exceptions:

- If the URL has an image extension, the link is embedded as an image, ``&lt;img/&gt;``.
- If the URL has an audio extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 audio ``&lt;audio/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a video extension, the link is embedded as HTML5 video ``&lt;video/&gt;``.
- If the URL has a MS Office or PDF extension, Google Doc Viewer is embedded, showing the content of the document (only works for public documents).
- If the URL points to a Youtube page, a Viemo page, or a Flickr page, web2py contacts the corrsponding web service and queries it about the propor way to embed the contect. This is done using the ``oembed`` protocol.

Here is a complete list of supported formats:
``
Image (.PNG, .GIF, .JPG, .JPEG)
Audio (.WAV, .OGG, .MP3)
Video (.MOV, .MPE, .MP4, .MPG, .MPG2, .MPEG, .MPEG4, .MOVIE)
``

Supported via Google Doc Viewer:

``
Microsoft Excel (.XLS and .XLSX)
Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 / 2010 (.PPTX)
Apple Pages (.PAGES)
Adobe PDF (.PDF)
Adobe Illustrator (.AI)
Adobe Photoshop (.PSD)
Autodesk AutoCad (.DXF)
Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG)
PostScript (.EPS, .PS)
TrueType (.TTF)
xml Paper Specification (.XPS)
``:code

Supported by oembed:

``
flickr.com
youtube.com
hulu.com
vimeo.com
slideshare.net
qik.com
polleverywhere.com
wordpress.com
revision3.com
viddler.com
``:code

This is implemeneted in the web2py file ``gluon.contrib.autolinks`` and specifically in the function ``expand_one``. You can extend oembed support by registering more services. This is done by appending an entry to the ``EMBED_MAPS`` list:

``
from gluon.contrib.autlinks import EMBED_MAPS
EMBED_MAPS.append((re.compile(&#x27;http://vimeo.com/\S*&#x27;),
                   &#x27;http://vimeo.com/api/oembed.json&#x27;))
``:code

#### Referencing wiki content

If you create a wiki page with slug &quot;contactus&quot; you can refer to this page as

``
\@////contactus
``:code

Here ``\@////`` stands for

``
\@/app/controller/function/
``:code

but &quot;app&quot;, &quot;controller&quot;, and &quot;function&quot; are omitted thus assuming default.

Similarly you can use the wiki menu to upload a media file (for example an image) linked to the page. The &quot;manage media&quot; page will show all files you have uploaded and will show the proper expression to link the media file. If, for example you upload a file &quot;test.jpg&quot; with title &quot;beach&quot;, the link expression will somthing like:

``
\@////15/beach.jpg
``:code

``\@////`` is the same prefix described before. ``15`` is the id of the record storing the media file. ``beach`` is the title. ``.jpg`` is the extension of the original file.

If you cut and paste ``\@////15/beach.jpg`` into wiki pages you embed the image.

Mind that media files are linked to pages and inherit access permission from the pages.

#### Wiki menus

If you create a page with slug &quot;wiki-menu&quot; page it will be interpreted as a description of the menu. Here is an example:

``
- Home &gt; \@////index
- Info &gt; \@////info
- web2py &gt; http://google.com
- - About us &gt; \@////aboutus
- - Countact us &gt; \@////contactus
``

Each line a menu item. We used double dash for nested menu ites. The ``&gt;`` symbols separates the menu item title from the menu item link.

Mind that the menu is appended to ``response.menu``. It does not replace it. The ``[wiki]`` menu tem with service functions is added automatically.

#### Service functions

If, for example, you want to use the wiki to create an editable sidebar you could create a page with ``slug=&quot;sidebar&quot;`` and then embed it in your layout.html with

``
{{=auth.wiki(slug=&#x27;sidebar&#x27;)}}
``:code

Notice that there is nothing special with the word &quot;sidebar&quot;. Any wiki page can be retrieved and emebdded in any point in your code. This allows you mix and match wiki functionalities with regular web2py functionalities.

You can also embed special wiki functions as the search by tags:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_search&#x27;)}}
``:code

or the tag cloud:

``
{{=auth.wiki(&#x27;_cloud&#x27;)}}
``:code

#### Components

One of the most powerful function of the new web2py consists in the ability of embedding an action inside another action. We call this a component.

Consider the following model:

``
db.define_table(&#x27;thing&#x27;,Field(&#x27;name&#x27;,requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
``:code

and the following action:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage_things():
    return SQLFORM.grid(db.thing)
``:code

This action is special because it returns a widget/helper not a dict of objects. Now we can embed this ``manage_things`` action into any view, with

``
{{=LOAD(&#x27;default&#x27;,&#x27;manage_things&#x27;,ajax=True)}}
``:code

This allows the visitor interact with the component via Ajax without reloadin the host page that embeds the widget. Basically the action is called via Ajax, inherits the stile of the host page, and capture all forms submissions and flash messages so that thye are handled within the current page. On top of this the ``SQLFORM.grid`` widget uses digitally signed URLs to restrict access. More informaiton about components can be found in chapter 13.

Components like the one above can be embedded into wiki pages using the MARKMIN syntax:

``
@{component:default/manage_things}
``

This simply tells web2py that we want to incude the &quot;manage_things&quot; action defined in the &quot;default&quot; controller as an Ajax &quot;component&quot;.

---------
Most users will be able to build relatively complex applications simply by using ``auth.wiki`` to create pages and menus, and embedded custom components into wiki pages. Wiki can be tough as a mechanism to allow members of the group to create pages but they calso be though as a way to develop applications in a modular way.
---------

### More on **admin**
``admin``:inxx

The administrative interface provides additional functionality that we briefly review here.

#### Site
``site``:inxx

This page lists all installed applications. There are two forms at the bottom.

The first of them allows creating a new application by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The second form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it. This can be its original name, but does not need to be. This allows installing multiple copies of the same application. You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or Instant Press CMS created by Martin Mulone:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or one of the many example applications available at:

``
http://web2py.com/appliances
``

------
Web2py files are packages as ``.w2p`` files. These ones are tar gzipped files. Web2py uses the ``.w2p`` extension instead of the ``.tgz`` extension to prevent the browser from unzipping on download. They can be uncompressed manually with ``tar zxvf [filename]`` although this is never necessary.
------

[[image @///image/en4100.png center 444px]]

Upon successful upload, web2py displays the MD5 checksum of the uploaded file. You can use it to verify that the file was not corrupted during upload. The InstantPress name will appear in the list of installed applications.

Click on the application name on admin to get it up and running.

If you run web2py from source and you have ``pyhton-git`` installed, you can install applications directly from git reporsitory using the ``.git`` URL in the upload form. In this case you will also be used to user the admin interface to push changes back into the repository.

For each application the &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page allows you to:
- Uninstall the application.
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Clean up temporary files (sessions, errors, and cache.disk files).
- Pack all. This returns a tar file containing a complete copy of the application. We suggest that you clean up temporary files before packing an application.
- Compile the application. If there are no errors, this option will bytecode-compile all models, controllers and views. Because views can extend and include other views in a tree, before bytecode compilation, the view tree for every controller is collapsed into a single file. The net effect is that a bytecode-compiled application is faster, because there is no more parsing of templates or string substitutions occurring at runtime.
- Pack compiled. This option is only present for bytecode-compiled applications. It allows packing the application without source code for distribution as closed source. Note that Python (as any other programming language) can technically be decompiled; therefore compilation does not provide complete protection of the source code. Nevertheless, decompilation can be difficult and can be illegal.
- Remove compiled. It simply removes the byte-code compiled models, views and controllers from the application. If the application was packaged with source code or edited locally, there is no harm in removing the bytecode-compiled files, and the application will continue to work. If the application was installed form a packed compiled file, then this is not safe, because there is no source code to revert to, and the application will no longer work.

``admin.py``:inxx

-------
All the functionality available from the web2py admin site page is also accessible programmatically via the API defined in the module ``gluon/admin.py``. Simply open a python shell and import this module.
-------

If the Google App Engine SDK is installer the admin &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page shows a button to push your applications to GAE. If ``python-git`` is installed, there is also a button to push your application to Open Shift. To install applications on ``heroku`` or other hosting system you should look into the &quot;scripts&quot; folder for the appropriate script.

#### About
``about``:inxx ``license``:inxx

The &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; tab allows editing the description of the application and its license. These are written respectively in the ABOUT and LICENSE files in the application folder.

[[image @///image/en4300.png center 480px]]

You can use ``MARKMIN``, or ``gluon.contrib.markdown.WIKI`` syntax for these files as described in ref.``markdown2``:cite .

#### Design
``EDIT``:inxx
You have used the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page already in this chapter. Here we want to point out a few more functionalities of the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page.
- If you click on any file name, you can see the contents of the file with syntax highlighting.
- If you click on edit, you can edit the file via a web interface.
- If you click on delete, you can delete the file (permanently).
- If you click on test, web2py will run tests. Tests are written by the developer using Python doctests, and each function should have its own tests.
- You can add language files, scan the app to discover all strings, and edit string translations via the web interface.
- If the static files are organized in folders and subfolders, the folder hierarchy can be toggled by clicking on a folder name.

The image below shows the output of the test page for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4400.png center 480px]]

The image below show the languages tab for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4500.png center 480px]]

The image below shows how to edit a language file, in this case the &quot;it&quot; (Italian) language for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4600.png center 480px]]

##### Intergated debugger

&#x27;&#x27;(requires Python 2.6 or later)&#x27;&#x27;

The web2py admin includes a web based debugger. Using the provided web-based editor you can add breakpoints to the Python code and, from the associated debugger console, you can inspect the system variables at those breakpoints and resume execution. This is illustrated in the following screenshot:

[[image @///image/debugger.png center 480px]]

This functionality is based on the Qdb debugger created by Mariano Reingart.
It uses multiprocessing.connection to communicate between the backend
and frontend, with a JSONRPC-like stream protocol. ``qdb``:cite

##### Shell

If you click on the &quot;shell&quot; link under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27;, web2py will open a web based Python shell and will execute the models for the current application. This allows you to interactively talk to your application.

[[image @///image/en4700.png center 480px]]

##### Crontab

Also under the controllers tab in &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; there is a &quot;crontab&quot; link. By clicking on this link you will be able to edit the web2py crontab file. This follows the same syntax as the unix crontab but does not rely on unix. In fact, it only requires web2py, and it works on Windows. It allows you to register actions that need to be executed in background at scheduled times.
For more information about this, see the next chapter.

#### Errors
``errors``:inxx

When programming web2py, you will inevitably make mistakes and introduce bugs. web2py helps in two ways: 1) it allows you to create tests for every function that can be run in the browser from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page; and 2) when an error manifests itself, a ticket is issued to the visitor and the error is logged.

Intentionally introduce an error in the images application as shown below:
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL,orderby=db.image.title)
    1/0
    return dict(images=images)
``:code

When you access the index action, you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en4800.png center 480px]]

Only the administrator can access the ticket:
The file &quot;0.py&quot; is very much self documented and if you are opening probably you

``
GAE_APPCFG = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(&#x27;/usr/local/bin/appcfg.py&#x27;))
``
This should point to the location of the &quot;appcfg.py&quot; file that comes with the Google App Engine SDK. If you have the SDK you may want to change this config parameters to the correct value. It will allow you to deploy to GAE from the admin interface.

``DEMO_MODE``:inxx

You can also set web2py admin in demo mode:
``
DEMO_MODE = True
FILTER_APPS = [&#x27;welcome&#x27;]
``
And only the apps listed in filter apps will be accessible and they will be only accessible in read-only mode.

``MULTI_USER_MODE``:inxx
``virtual laboratory``:inxx

If you are a teacher and want to expose the administrative interface to students so that students can share one administrative interface for their projects (think of a virtual lab), can do it by setting:
``
MULTI_USER_MODE = True
``
In this way students will be required to login and will only be able to access their own apps via admin. You, as first user/teacher, will be able to access them all.

In multi user mode, you can register students using the &quot;bulk register&quot; link in admin and manage them using the &quot;manage students&quot; link. The system also keep track of when students login and how many lines of code add/remove to/from their code. This data is presented to the administrator as charts under the application &quot;about&quot; page.

Mind that this mechanism still assumes all users are trusted. All the apps created under admin run under the same credentials on the same filesystem. It is possible for an app created by a student to access the data and the source of an app created by another student. It is also possible for a student to create an app that locks the server.

#### Mobile **admin**

Notice that the admin application includes &quot;plugin_jqmodile&quot; which packages jQuery Mobile. When admin is accessed from a mobile devide, this is detected by web2py and the interface is displayed using a mobile friendly layout.

#### Say my name
``form``:inxx ``request.vars``:inxx

Now create two pages (first and second), where the first page creates a form, asks the visitor&#x27;s name, and redirects to the second page, which greets the visitor by name.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1400.png center 293px]]

Write the corresponding actions in the default controller:
``
def first():
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then create a view &quot;default/first.html&quot; for the first action,
and enter:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;form action=&quot;second&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

Finally, create a view &quot;default/second.html&quot; for the second action:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=request.vars.visitor_name}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

``layout``:inxx
In both views we have extended the basic &quot;layout.html&quot; view that comes with web2py. The layout view keeps the look and feel of the two pages coherent. The layout file can be edited and replaced easily, since it mainly contains HTML code.

If you now visit the first page, type your name:

[[image @///image/en1500.png center 480px]]

and submit the form, you will receive a greeting:

[[image @///image/en1600.png center 480px]]

#### Postbacks
``redirect``:inxx ``URL``:inxx ``postback``:inxx

The mechanism for form submission that we used before is very common, but it is not good programming practice. All input should be validated and, in the above example, the burden of validation would fall on the second action. Thus the action that performs the validation is different from the action that generated the form. This tends to cause redundancy in the code.

A better pattern for form submission is to submit forms to the same action that generated them, in our example the &quot;first&quot;. The &quot;first&quot; action should receive the variables, process them, store them server-side, and redirect the visitor to the &quot;second&quot; page, which retrieves the variables. This mechanism is called a &#x27;&#x27;postback&#x27;&#x27;.

This approach is better also because the name of the visitor stays in the sessio
Note that if the &quot;second&quot; action is ever called before a visitor name is set, it will display &quot;Hello anonymous&quot; because  ``session.visitor_name`` returns ``None``. Alternatively we could have added the following code in the controller (inside the ``second`` function):

``
if not request.function==&#x27;first&#x27; and not session.visitor_name:
    redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
``:code

This is a general mechanism that you can use to enforce authorization on controllers, though see Chapter 9 for a more powerful method.

``FORM``:inxx ``INPUT``:inxx ``requires``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx

With web2py we can move one step further and ask web2py to generate the form for us, including validation. web2py provides helpers (FORM, INPUT, TEXTAREA, and SELECT/OPTION) with the same names as the equivalent HTML tags. They can be used to build forms either in the controller or in the view.

For example, here is one possible way to rewrite the first action:
``
def first():
    form = FORM(INPUT(_name=&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
              INPUT(_type=&#x27;submit&#x27;))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

where we are saying that the FORM tag contains two INPUT tags. The attributes of the input tags are specified by the named arguments starting with underscore. The ``requires`` argument is not a tag attribute (because it does not start by underscore) but it sets a validator for the value of visitor_name.

Here is yet another better way to create the same form:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, 
                                 label=&#x27;what is yout name?&#x27;,
                                 requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

The ``form`` object can be easily serialized in HTML by embedding it in the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view.
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
{{=form}}
``:code

The ``form.process()`` method applies the validators and returns the form itself. The ``form.accepted`` variable is set to True if the form was processed and passed validation. If the self-submitted form passes validation, it stores the variables in the session and redirects as before. If the form does not pass validation, error messages are inserted into the form and shown to the user, as below:

In the next section we will show how forms can be generated automatically from a model.

In all or examples we have used the session to pass the user name from the first action to the second. We could have used a different mechanism and pass data as part of a redirect URL:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;,vars=dict(name=name)))
    return dict(form=form)

def second():
    name = request.vars.visitor_name or redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
    return dict(name=name)
``:code

#### Internationalization

You code is likely to include hardcoded strings such as &quot;What is your name?&quot;. You should be able to customize strings without editing the code and in particular insert translations for these strings in different languages. In this wasy if a visitor has the language preference of the browser set to &quot;Italian&quot;, web2py will use the Italian translation for the strings, if available. This feature of web2py is called &quot;internationalization&quot; and it is described in more detail in the next chapter.

Here we just observe that in order to use this feature you should markup strings that need stranslation. This is done by wrapping a a quoted string in code such as 

``
&quot;What is your name?&quot;
``:code

with the ``T`` operator:

``
T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)
``:code


You can also mark fo translations strings hardcoded in views. For example

``
&lt;h1&gt;What is your name?&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

becomes

``
&lt;h1&gt;{{=T(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

It is good practice to do this for every string in the code (field labels, flash messages, etc.) except for tables and field names.

Once the strings are indentified and marked up, web2py takes care of almost evrything else. The admin interface also provides a page where you can translate each string in the languages you desire to support.

### An image blog
``upload``:inxx

Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments.

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;email&#x27;),
The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;
     src=&quot;{{=URL(&#x27;download&#x27;, args=image.file)}}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
{{if len(comments):}}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  {{for comment in comments:}}
    &lt;p&gt;{{=comment.author}} says &lt;i&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  {{pass}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{else:}}
  &lt;h2&gt;No comments posted yet&lt;/h2&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

This view displays the **image.file** by calling the &quot;download&quot; action inside an ``&lt;img ... /&gt;`` tag.
If there are comments, it loops over them and displays each one.

Here is how everything will appear to a visitor.

[[image @///image/en2900.png center 480px]]

When a visitor submits a comment via this page, the comment is stored in the database and appended at the bottom of the page.

#### Adding authentication

The web2py API for Role-Based Access Control is quite sophisticated, but for now we will limit ourselves to restricting access to the show action to authenticated users, deferring a more detailed discussion to Chapter 9.

To limit access to authenticated users, we need to complete three steps. In a model, for example &quot;db.py&quot;, we need to add:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables(username=True)
``:code

In our controller, we need to add one action:
``
def user():
    return dict(form=auth())
``:code

This is sufficient to enable login, register, logout, etc. pages. The default layout will also show options to the corresponding pages in the top right corner.

[[image @///image/en3000.png center 300px]]

We can now decorate the functions that we want to restrict, for example:
``
@auth.requires_login()
def show():
    ...
``:code

Any attempt to access
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/[image_id]
def manage():
``:code

with associated &quot;views/default/manage.html&quot;

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;Management Interface&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``

Using appadmin create a group &quot;manager&quot; and make some users members of the group. They will not be able to access

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/manage
``

and browse, search:

[[image @///image/en3200.png center 480px]]

create, update and delete images and their comments:

[[image @///image/en3300.png center 480px]]

#### Configuring the layout

You can configure the default layout by editing &quot;views/layout.html&quot; but you can also configure it without editing the HTML. In fact, the &quot;static/base.css&quot; stylesheet is well documented and described in Chapter 5. You can change color, columns, size, borders and background without editing the HTML. If you want to edit the menu, the title or the subtitle, you can do so in any model file. The scaffolding app, sets default values of these parameters in the file &quot;models/menu.py&quot;:

``
response.title = request.application
response.subtitle = &#x27;customize me!&#x27;
response.meta.author = &#x27;you&#x27;
response.meta.description = &#x27;describe your app&#x27;
response.meta.keywords = &#x27;bla bla bla&#x27;
response.menu = [ [ &#x27;Index&#x27;, False, URL(&#x27;index&#x27;) ] ]
``:code
</pre></div>
    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #F2DEDE;">#### Say my name
``form``:inxx ``request.vars``:inxx

Now create two pages (first and second), where the first page creates a form, asks the visitor&#x27;s name, and redirects to the second page, which greets the visitor by name.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1400.png center 293px]]

Write the corresponding actions in the default controller:
``
def first():
    return dict()

def second():
    return dict()
``:code

Then create a view &quot;default/first.html&quot; for the first action,
and enter:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
What is your name?
&lt;form action=&quot;second&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;visitor_name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
``:code

Finally, create a view &quot;default/second.html&quot; for the second action:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Hello {{=request.vars.visitor_name}}&lt;/h1&gt;
``:code

``layout``:inxx
In both views we have extended the basic &quot;layout.html&quot; view that comes with web2py. The layout view keeps the look and feel of the two pages coherent. The layout file can be edited and replaced easily, since it mainly contains HTML code.

If you now visit the first page, type your name:

[[image @///image/en1500.png center 480px]]

and submit the form, you will receive a greeting:

[[image @///image/en1600.png center 480px]]

#### Postbacks
``redirect``:inxx ``URL``:inxx ``postback``:inxx

The mechanism for form submission that we used before is very common, but it is not good programming practice. All input should be validated and, in the above example, the burden of validation would fall on the second action. Thus the action that performs the validation is different from the action that generated the form. This tends to cause redundancy in the code.

A better pattern for form submission is to submit forms to the same action that generated them, in our example the &quot;first&quot;. The &quot;first&quot; action should receive the variables, process them, store them server-side, and redirect the visitor to the &quot;second&quot; page, which retrieves the variables. This mechanism is called a &#x27;&#x27;postback&#x27;&#x27;.

This approach is better also because the name of the visitor stays in the sessio
Note that if the &quot;second&quot; action is ever called before a visitor name is set, it will display &quot;Hello anonymous&quot; because  ``session.visitor_name`` returns ``None``. Alternatively we could have added the following code in the controller (inside the ``second`` function):

``
if not request.function==&#x27;first&#x27; and not session.visitor_name:
    redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
``:code

This is a general mechanism that you can use to enforce authorization on controllers, though see Chapter 9 for a more powerful method.

``FORM``:inxx ``INPUT``:inxx ``requires``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx

With web2py we can move one step further and ask web2py to generate the form for us, including validation. web2py provides helpers (FORM, INPUT, TEXTAREA, and SELECT/OPTION) with the same names as the equivalent HTML tags. They can be used to build forms either in the controller or in the view.

For example, here is one possible way to rewrite the first action:
``
def first():
    form = FORM(INPUT(_name=&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
              INPUT(_type=&#x27;submit&#x27;))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

where we are saying that the FORM tag contains two INPUT tags. The attributes of the input tags are specified by the named arguments starting with underscore. The ``requires`` argument is not a tag attribute (because it does not start by underscore) but it sets a validator for the value of visitor_name.

Here is yet another better way to create the same form:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.visitor_name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

The ``form`` object can be easily serialized in HTML by embedding it in the &quot;default/first.html&quot; view.
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
What is your name?
{{=form}}
``:code

The ``form.process()`` method applies the validators and returns the form itself. The ``form.accepted`` variable is set to True if the form was processed and passed validation. If the self-submitted form passes validation, it stores the variables in the session and redirects as before. If the form does not pass validation, error messages are inserted into the form and shown to the user, as below:

[[image @///image/en1800.png center 480px]]

In the next section we will show how forms can be generated automatically from a model.

In all or examples we have used the session to pass the user name from the first action to the second. We could have used a different mechanism and pass data as part of a redirect URL:

``
def first():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(Field(&#x27;visitor_name&#x27;, requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
    if form.process().accepted:
        name = form.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;,vars=dict(name=name)))
    return dict(form=form)

def second():
    name = request.vars.visitor_name or redirect(URL(&#x27;first&#x27;))
    return dict(name=name)
``:code

### An image blog
``upload``:inxx

Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments.

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;email&#x27;),
The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;
     src=&quot;{{=URL(&#x27;download&#x27;, args=image.file)}}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
{{if len(comments):}}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  {{for comment in comments:}}
    &lt;p&gt;{{=comment.author}} says &lt;i&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  {{pass}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{else:}}
  &lt;h2&gt;No comments posted yet&lt;/h2&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

This view displays the **image.file** by calling the &quot;download&quot; action inside an ``&lt;img ... /&gt;`` tag.
If there are comments, it loops over them and displays each one.

Here is how everything will appear to a visitor.

[[image @///image/en2900.png center 480px]]

When a visitor submits a comment via this page, the comment is stored in the database and appended at the bottom of the page.

This mechanism is called a &#x27;&#x27;postback&#x27;&#x27;.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en1700.png center 200px]]

Modify the default controller to implement self-submission:
``
def first():
    if request.vars.visitor_name:
        session.visitor_name = request.vars.visitor_name
        redirect(URL(&#x27;second&#x27;))

### An image blog
``upload``:inxx

Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments.

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;email&#x27;),
is rendered as:
``:code

A handful of helpers (``INPUT``, ``TEXTAREA``, ``OPTION`` and ``SELECT``) also support some special named attributes not starting with underscore (``value``, and ``requires``). They are important for building custom forms and will be discussed later.

Go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. It now indicates that &quot;default.py exposes index&quot;. By clicking on &quot;index&quot;, you can visit the newly created page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/index
``:code

which looks like:

[[image @///image/en2800.png center 480px]]

If you click on the image name link, you are directed to:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/1
``:code

and this results in an error, since you have not yet created an action called &quot;show&quot; in controller &quot;default.py&quot;.

Let&#x27;s edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller and replace its content with:

``SQLFORM``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx ``response.flash``:inxx ``request.args``:inxx
``response.download``:inxx
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
    return dict(images=images)

def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = SQLFORM(db.comment)
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = &#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)

def download():
    return response.download(request, db)
``:code

The controller contains two actions: &quot;show&quot; and &quot;download&quot;.
The &quot;show&quot; action selects the image with the ``id`` parsed from the request args and all comments related to the image. &quot;show&quot; then passes everything to the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

The image id referenced by:
``
URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id)
``:code

in &quot;default/index.html&quot;, can be accessed as:

``request.args(0,cast=int)``

from the &quot;show&quot; action. The ``cast=int`` argument is optional but very important. It attempts to cast the string value passed in the PATH_INFO into an int. On failure it raise a proper exception instead of causing a ticket. One can also specify a redirect in case of failure to cast:

``request.args(0,cast=int,otherwise=URL(&#x27;error&#x27;))``

Moreover ``db.image(...)`` is a shortcut for 

``
db(db.image.id==...).select().first()
``:code

The &quot;download&quot; action expects a filename in ``request.args(0)``, builds a path to the location where that file is supposed to be, and sends it back to the client. If the file is too large, it streams the file without incurring any memory overhead.

Notice the following statements:
- Line 7 creates an insert form SQLFORM for the ``db.comment`` table using only the specified fields.
- Line 8 sets the value for the reference field, which is not part of the input form because it is not in the list of fields specified above.
- Line 9 processes the submitted form (the submitted form variables are in ``request.vars``) within the current session (the session is used to prevent double submissions, and to enforce navigation). If the submitted form variables are validated, the new comment is inserted in the ``db.comment`` table; otherwise the form is modified to include error messages (for example, if the author&#x27;s email address is invalid). This is all done in line 9!.
- Line 10 is only executed if the form is accepted, after the record is inserted into the database table. ``response.flash`` is a web2py variable that is displayed in the views and used to notify the visitor that something happened.
- Line 11 selects all comments that reference the current image.

-------
The &quot;download&quot; action is already defined in the &quot;default.py&quot; controller of the scaffolding application.
-------

The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view. The &quot;show&quot; action, though, should have a view, so return to **admin** and create a new view called &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;
     src=&quot;{{=URL(&#x27;download&#x27;, args=image.file)}}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
{{if len(comments):}}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  {{for comment in comments:}}
    &lt;p&gt;{{=comment.author}} says &lt;i&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  {{pass}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{else:}}
  &lt;h2&gt;No comments posted yet&lt;/h2&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

This view displays the **image.file** by calling the &quot;download&quot; action inside an ``&lt;img ... /&gt;`` tag.
If there are comments, it loops over them and displays each one.

Here is how everything will appear to a visitor.

[[image @///image/en2900.png center 480px]]

When a visitor submits a comment via this page, the comment is stored in the database and appended at the bottom of the page.

### Adding Authentication

The web2py API for Role-Based Access Control is quite sophisticated, but for now we will limit ourselves to restricting access to the show action to authenticated users, deferring a more detailed discussion to Chapter 9.

To limit access to authenticated users, we need to complete three steps. In a model, for example &quot;db.py&quot;, we need to add:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables(username=True)
``:code

In our controller, we need to add one action:
``
def user():
    return dict(form=auth())
``:code

This is sufficient to enable login, register, logout, etc. pages. The default layout will also show options to the corresponding pages in the top right corner.

[[image @///image/en3000.png center 300px]]

We can now decorate the functions that we want to restrict, for example:
``
@auth.requires_login()
def show():
    ...
``:code

Any attempt to access
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/[image_id]
``:code

will require login. If the user is not logged it, the user will be redirected to
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/login
``:code

[[image @///image/en3100.png center 480px]]

The ``user`` function also exposes, among others, the following actions:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/logout
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/register
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/profile
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/change_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/request_reset_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_username
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/verify_email
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/impersonate
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/not_authorized
``:code

Now, a first-time user needs to register in order to be able to log in and read or post comments.

-------
Both the ``auth`` object and the ``user`` function are already defined in the scaffolding application. The ``auth`` object is highly customizable and can deal with email verification, registration approvals, CAPTCHA, and alternate login methods via plugins.
-------

#### Adding grids

We can improve this further using the ``SQLFORM.grid`` and ``SQLFORM.smartgrid`` gadgets to create a management interface for our application:

``
@auth.requires_membership(&#x27;manager&#x27;)
def manage():
    grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.image,linked_tables=[&#x27;comment&#x27;])
    return dict(grid=grid)
``:code

with associated &quot;views/default/manage.html&quot;

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;Management Interface&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``

Using appadmin create a group &quot;manager&quot; and make some users members of the group. They will not be able to access

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/manage
``

and browse, search:

[[image @///image/en3200.png center 480px]]

create, update and delete images and their comments:

[[image @///image/en3300.png center 480px]]

### Configuring the layout

You can configure the default layout by editing &quot;views/layout.html&quot; but you can also configure it without editing the HTML. In fact, the &quot;static/base.css&quot; stylesheet is well documented and described in Chapter 5. You can change color, columns, size, borders and background without editing the HTML. If you want to edit the menu, the title or the subtitle, you can do so in any model file. The scaffolding app, sets default values of these parameters in the file &quot;models/menu.py&quot;:

``
response.title = request.application
response.subtitle = T(&#x27;customize me!&#x27;)
response.meta.author = &#x27;you&#x27;
response.meta.description = &#x27;describe your app&#x27;
response.meta.keywords = &#x27;bla bla bla&#x27;
response.menu = [ [ &#x27;Index&#x27;, False, URL(&#x27;index&#x27;) ] ]
``:code

### A wiki
``wiki``:inxx ``RSS``:inxx ``Ajax``:inxx ``XMLRPC``:inxx

In web2py you can create a complete Wiki with tags, tag could, search, media files, and oembed support using only one line of code:

``
def index(): return auth.wiki()
``:code

This function is documented later in this book and can be used to add a wiki to any existing application.

In this section, we build a wiki from scratch using only low level APIs. The visitor will be able to create pages, search them (by title), and edit them. The visitor will also be able to post comments (exactly as in the previous applications), and also post documents (as attachments to the pages) and link them from the pages. As a convention, we adopt the Markmin syntax for our wiki syntax. We will also implement a search page with Ajax, an RSS feed for the pages, and a handler to search the pages via XML-RPC``xmlrpc``:cite .

The following diagram lists the actions that we need to implement and the links we intend to build among them.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en3400.png center 250px]]

Start by creating a new scaffolding app, naming it &quot;mywiki&quot;.

The model must contain three tables: page, comment, and document. Both comment and document reference page because they belong to page. A document contains a file field of type upload as in the previous images application.

Here is the complete model:
``
db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)

from gluon.tools import *
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
crud = Crud(db)

db.define_table(&#x27;page&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;title&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id))
db.comment.created_on.readable = db.comment.created_on.writable = False
db.document.name.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, &#x27;document.name&#x27;)
db.document.page_id.readable = db.document.page_id.writable = False
db.document.created_by.readable = db.document.created_by.writable = False
db.document.created_on.readable = db.document.created_on.writable = False
``:code

Edit the controller &quot;default.py&quot; and create the following actions:
- index: list all wiki pages
- create: post another wiki page
- show: show a wiki page and its comments, and append comments
- edit: edit an existing page
- documents: manage the documents attached to a page
- download: download a document (as in the images example)
- search: display a search box and, via an Ajax callback, return all matching titles as the visitor types
- callback: the Ajax callback function. It returns the HTML that gets embedded in the search page while the visitor types.

Here is the &quot;default.py&quot; controller:
``
def index():
     &quot;&quot;&quot; this controller returns a dictionary rendered by the view

     &gt;&gt;&gt; index().has_key(&#x27;pages&#x27;)
     True

     return dict(pages=pages)

def show():
     &quot;shows a wiki page&quot;
     this_page = db.page(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))

         next = URL(&#x27;show&#x27;,args=request.args)) 
     return dict(form=form)

@auth.requires_login()
def documents():
     &quot;browser, edit all documents attached to a certain page&quot;
     page = db.page(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
     db.document.page_id.default = page.id
     db.document.page_id.writable = False
     grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.document.page_id==page.id,args=[page.id])
     return dict(page=page, grid=grid)

def user():
     return dict(form=auth())

def download():
     &quot;allows downloading of documents&quot;
     return response.download(request, db)

def search():
     &quot;an ajax wiki search page&quot;
     return dict(form=FORM(INPUT(_id=&#x27;keyword&#x27;,_name=&#x27;keyword&#x27;,
              _onkeyup=&quot;ajax(&#x27;callback&#x27;, [&#x27;keyword&#x27;], &#x27;target&#x27;);&quot;)),
              target_div=DIV(_id=&#x27;target&#x27;))

def callback():
     &quot;an ajax callback that returns a &lt;ul&gt; of links to wiki pages&quot;
     query = db.page.title.contains(request.vars.keyword)
     pages = db(query).select(orderby=db.page.title)
     links = [A(p.title, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;,args=p.id)) for p in pages]
     return UL(*links)
The handler can be accessed from many other programming languages that understan
There are three different representation for each of the field types ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time``:
- the database representation
- the internal web2py prepresentation
- the string representation in forms and tables

The database representation is an internal issue and does not affect the code. Internally, at the web2py level, they are stored as ``datetime.date``, ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.time`` object respectively and they can be manipulated as such:

``
for page in db(db.page).select():
    print page.title, page.day, page.month, page.year
``

When dates are converted to strings in forms they are converted using the ISO representation 
``
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
``

yet this representation in internationalized and you can use the admin stranslation page to change the format to an alternate one. For example:

``
%m/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S
``

------
Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications is already written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need declare that the application current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``
------

### More on **admin**
``admin``:inxx

The administrative interface provides additional functionality that we briefly review here.

#### &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27;
``site``:inxx

This page lists all installed applications. There are two forms at the bottom.

The first of them allows creating a new application by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx ``Movuca``:inxx
The second form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it. This can be its original name, but does not need to be. This allows installing multiple copies of the same application. You can try, for example, to upload the Movuca Social Networking application app created by Bruno Rocha:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or Instant Press CMS created by Martin Mulone:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

or one of the many example applications available at:

``
http://web2py.com/appliances
``

------
Web2py files are packages as ``.w2p`` files. These ones are tar gzipped files. Web2py uses the ``.w2p`` extension instead of the ``.tgz`` extension to prevent the browser from unzipping on download. They can be uncompressed manually with ``tar zxvf [filename]`` although this is never necessary.
------

[[image @///image/en4100.png center 444px]]

Upon successful upload, web2py displays the MD5 checksum of the uploaded file. You can use it to verify that the file was not corrupted during upload. The InstantPress name will appear in the list of installed applications.

Click on the application name on admin to get it up and running.

If you run web2py from source and you have ``pyhton-git`` installed, you can install applications directly from git reporsitory using the ``.git`` URL in the upload form. In this case you will also be used to user the admin interface to push changes back into the repository.

For each application the &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page allows you to:
- Uninstall the application.
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Clean up temporary files (sessions, errors, and cache.disk files).
- Pack all. This returns a tar file containing a complete copy of the application. We suggest that you clean up temporary files before packing an application.
- Compile the application. If there are no errors, this option will bytecode-compile all models, controllers and views. Because views can extend and include other views in a tree, before bytecode compilation, the view tree for every controller is collapsed into a single file. The net effect is that a bytecode-compiled application is faster, because there is no more parsing of templates or string substitutions occurring at runtime.
- Pack compiled. This option is only present for bytecode-compiled applications. It allows packing the application without source code for distribution as closed source. Note that Python (as any other programming language) can technically be decompiled; therefore compilation does not provide complete protection of the source code. Nevertheless, decompilation can be difficult and can be illegal.
- Remove compiled. It simply removes the byte-code compiled models, views and controllers from the application. If the application was packaged with source code or edited locally, there is no harm in removing the bytecode-compiled files, and the application will continue to work. If the application was installed form a packed compiled file, then this is not safe, because there is no source code to revert to, and the application will no longer work.

``admin.py``:inxx

-------
All the functionality available from the web2py admin site page is also accessible programmatically via the API defined in the module ``gluon/admin.py``. Simply open a python shell and import this module.
-------

If the Google App Engine SDK is installer the admin &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page shows a button to push your applications to GAE. If ``python-git`` is installed, there is also a button to push your application to Open Shift. To install applications on ``heroku`` or other hosting system you should look into the &quot;scripts&quot; folder for the appropriate script.

#### &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27;
``about``:inxx ``license``:inxx

The &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; tab allows editing the description of the application and its license. These are written respectively in the ABOUT and LICENSE files in the application folder.

[[image @///image/en4300.png center 480px]]

You can use ``MARKMIN``, or ``gluon.contrib.markdown.WIKI`` syntax for these files as described in ref.``markdown2``:cite .

#### &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27;
``EDIT``:inxx
You have used the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page already in this chapter. Here we want to point out a few more functionalities of the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page.
- If you click on any file name, you can see the contents of the file with syntax highlighting.
- If you click on edit, you can edit the file via a web interface.
- If you click on delete, you can delete the file (permanently).
- If you click on test, web2py will run tests. Tests are written by the developer using Python doctests, and each function should have its own tests.
- You can add language files, scan the app to discover all strings, and edit string translations via the web interface.
- If the static files are organized in folders and subfolders, the folder hierarchy can be toggled by clicking on a folder name.

The image below shows the output of the test page for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4400.png center 480px]]

The image below show the languages tab for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4500.png center 480px]]

The image below shows how to edit a language file, in this case the &quot;it&quot; (Italian) language for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4600.png center 480px]]
Normally there is no need to perform any configuration of admin but a few custom
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/edit/admin/models/0.py
``
Notice that **admin** can be used to edit itself. In fact **admin** is an app as any other one.

The file &quot;0.py&quot; is very much self documented and if you are opening probably you already know what you are looking for. Anyway few customizations exist that are more important than others:

``
GAE_APPCFG = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(&#x27;/usr/local/bin/appcfg.py&#x27;))
``
This should point to the location of the &quot;appcfg.py&quot; file that comes with the Google App Engine SDK. If you have the SDK you may want to change this config parameters to the correct value. It will allow you to deploy to GAE from the admin interface.

``DEMO_MODE``:inxx

You can also set web2py admin in demo mode:
``
DEMO_MODE = True
FILTER_APPS = [&#x27;welcome&#x27;]
``
And only the apps listed in filter apps will be accessible and they will be only accessible in read-only mode.

``MULTI_USER_MODE``:inxx
``virtual laboratory``:inxx

If you are a teacher and want to expose the administrative interface to students so that students can share one administrative interface for their projects (think of a virtual lab), can do it by setting:
``
MULTI_USER_MODE = True
``
In this way students will be required to login and will only be able to access their own apps via admin. You, as first user/teacher, will be able to access them all.

In multi user mode, you can register students using the &quot;bulk register&quot; link in admin and manage them using the &quot;manage students&quot; link. The system also keep track of when students login and how many lines of code add/remove to/from their code. This data is presented to the administrator as charts under the application &quot;about&quot; page.

Mind that this mechanism still assumes all users are trusted. All the apps created under admin run under the same credentials on the same filesystem. It is possible for an app created by a student to access the data and the source of an app created by another student. It is also possible for a student to create an app that locks the server.

#### Mobile **admin**

Notice that the admin application includes &quot;plugin_jqmodile&quot; which packages jQuery Mobile. When admin is accessed from a mobile devide, this is detected by web2py and the interface is displayed using a mobile friendly layout.

``upload``:inxx

Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments.

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;email&#x27;),
is rendered as:
``:code

A handful of helpers (``INPUT``, ``TEXTAREA``, ``OPTION`` and ``SELECT``) also support some special named attributes not starting with underscore (``value``, and ``requires``). They are important for building custom forms and will be discussed later.

Go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. It now indicates that &quot;default.py exposes index&quot;. By clicking on &quot;index&quot;, you can visit the newly created page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/index
``:code

which looks like:

[[image @///image/en2800.png center 480px]]

If you click on the image name link, you are directed to:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/1
``:code

and this results in an error, since you have not yet created an action called &quot;show&quot; in controller &quot;default.py&quot;.

Let&#x27;s edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller and replace its content with:

``SQLFORM``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx ``response.flash``:inxx ``request.args``:inxx
``response.download``:inxx
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
    return dict(images=images)

def show():
    image = db(db.image.id==request.args(0,cast=int)).select().first()
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = SQLFORM(db.comment)
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = &#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)

def download():
    return response.download(request, db)
``:code

The controller contains two actions: &quot;show&quot; and &quot;download&quot;.
The &quot;show&quot; action selects the image with the ``id`` parsed from the request args and all comments related to the image. &quot;show&quot; then passes everything to the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

The image id referenced by:
``
URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id)
``:code

in &quot;default/index.html&quot;, can be accessed as:

``request.args(0,cast=int)``

from the &quot;show&quot; action. The ``cast=int`` argument is optional but very important. It attempts to cast the string value passed in the PATH_INFO into an int. On failure it raise a proper exception instead of causing a ticket. One can also specify a redirect in case of failure to cast:

``request.args(0,cast=int,otherwise=URL(&#x27;error&#x27;))``

The &quot;download&quot; action expects a filename in ``request.args(0)``, builds a path to the location where that file is supposed to be, and sends it back to the client. If the file is too large, it streams the file without incurring any memory overhead.

Notice the following statements:
- Line 7 creates an insert form SQLFORM for the ``db.comment`` table using only the specified fields.
- Line 8 sets the value for the reference field, which is not part of the input form because it is not in the list of fields specified above.
- Line 9 processes the submitted form (the submitted form variables are in ``request.vars``) within the current session (the session is used to prevent double submissions, and to enforce navigation). If the submitted form variables are validated, the new comment is inserted in the ``db.comment`` table; otherwise the form is modified to include error messages (for example, if the author&#x27;s email address is invalid). This is all done in line 9!.
- Line 10 is only executed if the form is accepted, after the record is inserted into the database table. ``response.flash`` is a web2py variable that is displayed in the views and used to notify the visitor that something happened.
- Line 11 selects all comments that reference the current image.

-------
The &quot;download&quot; action is already defined in the &quot;default.py&quot; controller of the scaffolding application.
-------

The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view. The &quot;show&quot; action, though, should have a view, so return to **admin** and create a new view called &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;
     src=&quot;{{=URL(&#x27;download&#x27;, args=image.file)}}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
{{if len(comments):}}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  {{for comment in comments:}}
    &lt;p&gt;{{=comment.author}} says &lt;i&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  {{pass}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{else:}}
  &lt;h2&gt;No comments posted yet&lt;/h2&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

This view displays the **image.file** by calling the &quot;download&quot; action inside an ``&lt;img ... /&gt;`` tag.
If there are comments, it loops over them and displays each one.

Here is how everything will appear to a visitor.

[[image @///image/en2900.png center 480px]]

When a visitor submits a comment via this page, the comment is stored in the database and appended at the bottom of the page.

### Adding CRUD

web2py also provides a CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) API that simplifies forms even more. To use CRUD it is necessary to define it somewhere, such as in file &quot;db.py&quot;:
``
from gluon.tools import Crud
crud = Crud(db)
``:code

These two lines are already in the scaffolding application.

The ``crud`` object provides high-level methods, for example:
``
form = crud.create(table)
``:code

that can be used to replace the programming pattern:
``
form = SQLFORM(table)
if form.process().accepted:
    session.flash = &#x27;...&#x27;
    redirect(&#x27;...&#x27;)
``:code

Here, we rewrite the previous &quot;show&quot; action using crud and making some more improvements:

``
def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = crud.create(db.comment,
                       message=&#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;,
		       next=URL(args=image.id))
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)
``:code

First of all notice we have used the syntax

``
db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(...)
``:code

to fetch the required record. Since ```table(id)`` returns None if the record is not found, we can use ``or redirect(...)`` in this case in one line.

The ``next`` argument of ``crud.create`` is the URL to redirect to after the form is accepted. The ``message`` argument is the one to be displayed upon acceptance. You can read more about CRUD in Chapter 7.

### Adding Authentication

The web2py API for Role-Based Access Control is quite sophisticated, but for now we will limit ourselves to restricting access to the show action to authenticated users, deferring a more detailed discussion to Chapter 9.

To limit access to authenticated users, we need to complete three steps. In a model, for example &quot;db.py&quot;, we need to add:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
``:code

In our controller, we need to add one action:
``
def user():
    return dict(form=auth())
``:code

This is sufficient to enable login, register, logout, etc. pages. The default layout will also show options to the corresponding pages in the top right corner.

[[image @///image/en3000.png center 300px]]

We can now decorate the functions that we want to restrict, for example:
``
@auth.requires_login()
def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = crud.create(db.comment, next=URL(args=image.id),
                     message=&#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;)
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)
``:code

Any attempt to access
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/[image_id]
``:code

will require login. If the user is not logged it, the user will be redirected to
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/login
``:code

[[image @///image/en3100.png center 480px]]

The ``user`` function also exposes, among others, the following actions:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/logout
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/register
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/profile
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/change_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/request_reset_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_username
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/verify_email
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/impersonate
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/not_authorized
``:code

Now, a first-time user needs to register in order to be able to log in and read or post comments.

-------
Both the ``auth`` object and the ``user`` function are already defined in the scaffolding application. The ``auth`` object is highly customizable and can deal with email verification, registration approvals, CAPTCHA, and alternate login methods via plugins.
-------

#### Adding grids

We can improve this further using the ``SQLFORM.grid`` and ``SQLFORM.smartgrid`` gadgets to create a management interface for our application:

``
@auth.requires_membership(&#x27;manager&#x27;)
def manage():
    grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.image)
    return dict(grid=grid)
``:code

with associated &quot;views/default/manage.html&quot;

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;Management Interface&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``

Using appadmin create a group &quot;manager&quot; and make some users members of the group. They will not be able to access

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/manage
``

and browse, search:

[[image @///image/en3200.png center 480px]]

create, update and delete images and their comments:

[[image @///image/en3300.png center 480px]]

### Configuring the layout

You can configure the default layout by editing &quot;views/layout.html&quot; but you can also configure it without editing the HTML. In fact, the &quot;static/base.css&quot; stylesheet is well documented and described in Chapter 5. You can change color, columns, size, borders and background without editing the HTML. If you want to edit the menu, the title or the subtitle, you can do so in any model file. The scaffolding app, sets default values of these parameters in the file &quot;models/menu.py&quot;:

``
response.title = request.application
response.subtitle = T(&#x27;customize me!&#x27;)
response.meta.author = &#x27;you&#x27;
response.meta.description = &#x27;describe your app&#x27;
response.meta.keywords = &#x27;bla bla bla&#x27;
response.menu = [ [ &#x27;Index&#x27;, False, URL(&#x27;index&#x27;) ] ]
``:code

### A wiki
``wiki``:inxx ``RSS``:inxx ``Ajax``:inxx ``XMLRPC``:inxx
In this section, we build a wiki, from scratch and without using the extended functionality provided by plugin_wiki which is described in chapter 12. The visitor will be able to create pages, search them (by title), and edit them. The visitor will also be able to post comments (exactly as in the previous applications), and also post documents (as attachments to the pages) and link them from the pages. As a convention, we adopt the Markmin syntax for our wiki syntax. We will also implement a search page with Ajax, an RSS feed for the pages, and a handler to search the pages via XML-RPC``xmlrpc``:cite .

The following diagram lists the actions that we need to implement and the links we intend to build among them.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en3400.png center 250px]]

Start by creating a new scaffolding app, naming it &quot;mywiki&quot;.

The model must contain three tables: page, comment, and document. Both comment and document reference page because they belong to page. A document contains a file field of type upload as in the previous images application.

Here is the complete model:
``
db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)

from gluon.tools import *
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
crud = Crud(db)

db.define_table(&#x27;page&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;title&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id))
db.comment.created_on.readable = db.comment.created_on.writable = False
db.document.name.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, &#x27;document.name&#x27;)
db.document.page_id.readable = db.document.page_id.writable = False
db.document.created_by.readable = db.document.created_by.writable = False
db.document.created_on.readable = db.document.created_on.writable = False
``:code

Edit the controller &quot;default.py&quot; and create the following actions:
- index: list all wiki pages
- create: post another wiki page
- show: show a wiki page and its comments, and append comments
- edit: edit an existing page
- documents: manage the documents attached to a page
- download: download a document (as in the images example)
- search: display a search box and, via an Ajax callback, return all matching titles as the visitor types
- callback: the Ajax callback function. It returns the HTML that gets embedded in the search page while the visitor types.

Here is the &quot;default.py&quot; controller:

     db.document.page_id.default = page.id
     db.document.page_id.writable = False

     return dict(page=page, grid=grid)

def callback():
     &quot;an ajax callback that returns a &lt;ul&gt; of links to wiki pages&quot;
     query = db.page.title.contains(request.vars.keyword)
     pages = db(query).select(orderby=db.page.title)
     links = [A(p.title, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;,args=p.id)) for p in pages]
     return UL(*links)
The handler can be accessed from many other programming languages that understan
There are three different representation for each of the field types ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time``:
- the database representation
- the internal web2py prepresentation
- the string representation in forms and tables

The database representation is an internal issue and does not affect the code. Internally, at the web2py level, they are stored as ``datetime.date``, ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.time`` object respectively and they can be manipulated as such:

``
for page in db(db.page).select():
    print page.title, page.day, page.month, page.year
``

When dates are converted to strings in forms they are converted using the ISO representation 
``
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
``

yet this representation in internationalized and you can use the admin stranslation page to change the format to an alternate one. For example:

``
%m/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S
``

------
Mind that by default English is not translated because web2py assumes the applications is already written in English. If you want internationalization to work for English you need to create the translation file (using admin) and you need declare that the application current language is something other than english, for example:
``
T.current_languages = [&#x27;null&#x27;]
``
------




### More on **admin**
``admin``:inxx

The administrative interface provides additional functionality that we briefly review here.

#### &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27;
``site``:inxx

This page lists all installed applications. There are two forms at the bottom.

The first of them allows creating a new application by specifying its name.

``Instant Press``:inxx
The second form allows uploading an existing application from either a local file or a remote URL. When you upload an application, you need to specify a name for it. This can be its original name, but does not need to be. This allows installing multiple copies of the same application. You can try, for example, to upload the the Instant Press CMS created by Martin Mulone from:

``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``:code

------
Web2py files are packages as ``.w2p`` files. These ones are tar gzipped files. Web2py uses the ``.w2p`` extension instead of the ``.tgz`` extension to prevent the browser from unzipping on download. They can be uncompressed manually with ``tar zxvf [filename]`` although this is never necessary.
------

[[image @///image/en4100.png center 444px]]

Upon successful upload, web2py displays the MD5 checksum of the uploaded file. You can use it to verify that the file was not corrupted during upload. The InstantPress name will appear in the list of installed applications.

Click on the InstantPress name on admin to get it up and running.

[[image @///image/en4200.png center 480px]]

You can read more about Instant Press at the following URL:
``
http://code.google.com/p/instant-press/
``

For each application the &#x27;&#x27;site&#x27;&#x27; page allows you to:
- Uninstall the application.
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Jump to the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page (read below).
- Clean up temporary files (sessions, errors, and cache.disk files).
- Pack all. This returns a tar file containing a complete copy of the application. We suggest that you clean up temporary files before packing an application.
- Compile the application. If there are no errors, this option will bytecode-compile all models, controllers and views. Because views can extend and include other views in a tree, before bytecode compilation, the view tree for every controller is collapsed into a single file. The net effect is that a bytecode-compiled application is faster, because there is no more parsing of templates or string substitutions occurring at runtime.
- Pack compiled. This option is only present for bytecode-compiled applications. It allows packing the application without source code for distribution as closed source. Note that Python (as any other programming language) can technically be decompiled; therefore compilation does not provide complete protection of the source code. Nevertheless, decompilation can be difficult and can be illegal.
- Remove compiled. It simply removes the byte-code compiled models, views and controllers from the application. If the application was packaged with source code or edited locally, there is no harm in removing the bytecode-compiled files, and the application will continue to work. If the application was installed form a packed compiled file, then this is not safe, because there is no source code to revert to, and the application will no longer work.

``admin.py``:inxx

-------
All the functionality available from the web2py admin site page is also accessible programmatically via the API defined in the module ``gluon/admin.py``. Simply open a python shell and import this module.
-------

#### &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27;
``about``:inxx ``license``:inxx

The &#x27;&#x27;about&#x27;&#x27; tab allows editing the description of the application and its license. These are written respectively in the ABOUT and LICENSE files in the application folder.

[[image @///image/en4300.png center 480px]]

You can use ``MARKMIN``, or ``gluon.contrib.markdown.WIKI`` syntax for these files as described in ref.``markdown2``:cite .

#### &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27;
``EDIT``:inxx
You have used the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page already in this chapter. Here we want to point out a few more functionalities of the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page.
- If you click on any file name, you can see the contents of the file with syntax highlighting.
- If you click on edit, you can edit the file via a web interface.
- If you click on delete, you can delete the file (permanently).
- If you click on test, web2py will run tests. Tests are written by the developer using Python doctests, and each function should have its own tests.
- You can add language files, scan the app to discover all strings, and edit string translations via the web interface.
- If the static files are organized in folders and subfolders, the folder hierarchy can be toggled by clicking on a folder name.

The image below shows the output of the test page for the welcome application.

The image below show the languages tab for the welcome application.

[[image @///image/en4500.png center 480px]]

The image below shows how to edit a language file, in this case the &quot;it&quot; (Italian) language for the welcome application.

Normally there is no need to perform any configuration of admin but a few custom
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/edit/admin/models/0.py
``
Notice that **admin** can be used to edit itself. In fact **admin** is an app as any other one.

The file &quot;0.py&quot; is very much self documented and if you are opening probably you already know what you are looking for. Anyway few customizations exist that are more important than others:

``
GAE_APPCFG = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(&#x27;/usr/local/bin/appcfg.py&#x27;))
``
This should point to the location of the &quot;appcfg.py&quot; file that comes with the Google App Engine SDK. If you have the SDK you may want to change this config parameters to the correct value. It will allow you to deploy to GAE from the admin interface.

``DEMO_MODE``:inxx

You can also set web2py admin in demo mode:
``
DEMO_MODE = True
FILTER_APPS = [&#x27;welcome&#x27;]
``
And only the apps listed in filter apps will be accessible and they will be only accessible in read-only mode.

``MULTI_USER_MODE``:inxx
``virtual laboratory``:inxx

If you are a teacher and want to expose the administrative interface to students so that students can share one administrative interface for their projects (think of a virtual lab), can do it by setting:
``
MULTI_USER_MODE = True
``
In this way students will be required to login and will only be able to access their own apps via admin. You, as first user/teacher, will be able to access them all.

Mind that this mechanism still assumes all users are trusted. All the apps created under admin run under the same credentials on the same filesystem. It is possible for an app created by a student to access the data and the source of an app created by another student.

    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #DFF0D8;">Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments (posts).

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;post&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;email&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;))

db.image.title.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)
db.post.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
db.post.author.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()
db.post.email.requires = IS_EMAIL()
db.post.body.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()

db.post.image_id.writable = db.post.image_id.readable = False
``:code

Let&#x27;s analyze this line by line.

Line 1 defines a global variable called ``db`` that represents the database connection. In this case it is a connection to a SQLite database stored in the file  &quot;applications/images/databases/storage.sqlite&quot;. In the SQLite case, if the database does not exist, it is created. You can change the name of the file, as well as the name of the global variable ``db``, but it is convenient to give them the same name, to make it easy to remember.

Lines 3-5 define a table &quot;image&quot;. ``define_table`` is a method of the ``db`` object. The first argument, &quot;image&quot;, is the name of the table we are defining. The other arguments are the fields belonging to that table. This table has a field called &quot;title&quot;, a field called &quot;file&quot;, and a field called &quot;id&quot; that serves as the table primary key (&quot;id&quot; is not explicitly declared because all tables have an id field by default). The field &quot;title&quot; is a string, and the field &quot;file&quot; is of type &quot;upload&quot;. &quot;upload&quot; is a special type of field used by the web2py Data Abstraction Layer (DAL) to store the names of uploaded files. web2py knows how to upload files (via streaming if they are large), rename them safely, and store them.

When a table is defined, web2py takes one of several possible actions:
- if the table does not exist, the table is created;
- if the table exists and does not correspond to the definition, the table is altered accordingly, and if a field has a different type, web2py tries to convert its contents;
- if the table exists and corresponds to the definition, web2py does nothing.

This behavior is called &quot;migration&quot;. In web2py migrations are automatic, but can be disabled for each table by passing ``migrate=False`` as the last argument of ``define_table``.

Line 6 defines a format string for the table. It determines how a record should be represented as a string. Notice that the ``format`` argument can also be a function that takes a record and returns a string. For example:

``
format=lambda row: row.title
``:code

Lines 8-12 define another table called &quot;post&quot;.
A post has an &quot;author&quot;, an &quot;email&quot; (we intend to store the email address of the author of the post), a &quot;body&quot; of type &quot;text&quot; (we intend to use it to store the actual comment posted by the author), and an &quot;image_id&quot; field of type reference that points to ``db.image`` via the &quot;id&quot; field.

In line 14, ``db.image.title`` represents the field &quot;title&quot; of table &quot;image&quot;. The attribute ``requires`` allows you to set requirements/constraints that will be enforced by web2py forms. Here we require that the &quot;title&quot; is unique:

``IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)``:code

&#x27;&#x27;Notice this is optional because it is set automatically given that ``Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True)``&#x27;&#x27;.

The objects representing these constraints are called validators. Multiple validators can be grouped in a list. Validators are executed in the order they appear.
``IS_NOT_IN_DB(a, b)`` is a special validator that checks that the value of a field ``b`` for a new record is not already in ``a``.

Line 15 requires that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;post&quot; is in ``db.image.id``. As far as the database is concerned, we had already declared this  when we defined the table &quot;post&quot;.
Now we are explicitly telling the model that this condition should be enforced by web2py, too, at the form processing level when a new comment is posted, so that invalid values do not propagate from input forms to the database. We also require that the &quot;image_id&quot; be represented by the &quot;title&quot;, ``&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;``, of the corresponding record.

Line 20 indicates that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;post&quot; should not be shown in forms, ``writable=False`` and not even in readonly forms, ``readable=False``.

The meaning of the validators in lines 15-17 should be obvious.

``format``:inxx
Notice that the validator
``
db.post.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

can be omitted (and would be automatic) if we specify a format for referenced table:
``
db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;, ..., format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

where the format can be a string or a function that takes a record and returns a string.

``appadmin``:inxx
Once a model is defined, if there are no errors, web2py creates an application administration interface to manage the database. You access it via the &quot;database administration&quot; link in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page or directly:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/appadmin
``:code

Here is a screenshot of the **appadmin** interface:

[[image @///image/en2100.png center 480px]]

This interface is coded in the controller called &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and the corresponding view &quot;appadmin.html&quot;. From now on, we will refer to this interface simply as **appadmin**. It allows the administrator to insert new database records, edit and delete existing records, browse tables, and perform database joins.

The first time **appadmin** is accessed, the model is executed and the tables are created. The web2py DAL translates Python code into SQL statements that are specific to the selected database back-end (SQLite in this example). You can see the generated SQL from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page by clicking on the &quot;sql.log&quot; link under &quot;models&quot;. Notice that the link is not present until the tables have been created.

[[image @///image/en2200.png center 480px]]

If you were to edit the model and access **appadmin** again, web2py would generate SQL to alter the existing tables. The generated SQL is logged into &quot;sql.log&quot;.

Now go back to **appadmin** and try to insert a new image record:

[[image @///image/en2300.png center 480px]]
is rendered as:

A handful of helpers (``INPUT``, ``TEXTAREA``, ``OPTION`` and ``SELECT``) also support some special named attributes not starting with underscore (``value``, and ``requires``). They are important for building custom forms and will be discussed later.

Go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. It now indicates that &quot;default.py exposes index&quot;. By clicking on &quot;index&quot;, you can visit the newly created page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/index
``:code

which looks like:

[[image @///image/en2800.png center 480px]]

If you click on the image name link, you are directed to:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/1
``:code

and this results in an error, since you have not yet created an action called &quot;show&quot; in controller &quot;default.py&quot;.

Let&#x27;s edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller and replace its content with:

``SQLFORM``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx ``response.flash``:inxx ``request.args``:inxx
``response.download``:inxx
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
    return dict(images=images)

def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.post.image_id.default = image.id
    form = SQLFORM(db.post)
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = &#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;
    comments = db(db.post.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)

def download():
    return response.download(request, db)
``:code

The controller contains two actions: &quot;show&quot; and &quot;download&quot;.
The &quot;show&quot; action selects the image with the ``id`` parsed from the request args and all comments related to the image. &quot;show&quot; then passes everything to the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

The image id referenced by:
``
URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id)
``:code

in &quot;default/index.html&quot;, can be accessed as:

``request.args(0,cast=int)``

from the &quot;show&quot; action. The ``cast=int`` argument is optional but very important. It attempts to cast the string value passed in the PATH_INFO into an int. On failure it raise a proper exception instead of causing a ticket. One can also specify a redirect in case of failure to cast:

``request.args(0,cast=int,otherwise=URL(&#x27;error&#x27;))``

Moreover ``db.image(...)`` is a shortcut for

``
db(db.image.id==...).select().first()
``:code

The &quot;download&quot; action expects a filename in ``request.args(0)``, builds a path to the location where that file is supposed to be, and sends it back to the client. If the file is too large, it streams the file without incurring any memory overhead.

Notice the following statements:
- Line 7 creates an insert form SQLFORM for the ``db.post`` table using only the specified fields.
- Line 8 sets the value for the reference field, which is not part of the input form because it is not in the list of fields specified above.
- Line 9 processes the submitted form (the submitted form variables are in ``request.vars``) within the current session (the session is used to prevent double submissions, and to enforce navigation). If the submitted form variables are validated, the new comment is inserted in the ``db.post`` table; otherwise the form is modified to include error messages (for example, if the author&#x27;s email address is invalid). This is all done in line 9!.
- Line 10 is only executed if the form is accepted, after the record is inserted into the database table. ``response.flash`` is a web2py variable that is displayed in the views and used to notify the visitor that something happened.
- Line 11 selects all comments that reference the current image.

-------
The &quot;download&quot; action is already defined in the &quot;default.py&quot; controller of the scaffolding application.
-------

The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view. The &quot;show&quot; action, though, should have a view, so return to **admin** and create a new view called &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;
     src=&quot;{{=URL(&#x27;download&#x27;, args=image.file)}}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
{{if len(comments):}}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  {{for post in comments:}}
    &lt;p&gt;{{=post.author}} says &lt;i&gt;{{=post.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  {{pass}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{else:}}
  &lt;h2&gt;No comments posted yet&lt;/h2&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

This view displays the **image.file** by calling the &quot;download&quot; action inside an ``&lt;img ... /&gt;`` tag.
If there are comments, it loops over them and displays each one.

Here is how everything will appear to a visitor.

[[image @///image/en2900.png center 480px]]

When a visitor submits a comment via this page, the comment is stored in the database and appended at the bottom of the page.

#### Adding authentication

The web2py API for Role-Based Access Control is quite sophisticated, but for now we will limit ourselves to restricting access to the show action to authenticated users, deferring a more detailed discussion to Chapter 9.

To limit access to authenticated users, we need to complete three steps. In a model, for example &quot;db.py&quot;, we need to add:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables(username=True)
``:code

In our controller, we need to add one action:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/login

[[image @///image/en3100.png center 480px]]

The ``user`` function also exposes, among others, the following actions:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/logout
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/register
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/profile
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/change_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/request_reset_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_username
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/verify_email
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/impersonate
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/not_authorized
``:code

Now, a first-time user needs to register in order to be able to log in and read or post comments.

-------
Both the ``auth`` object and the ``user`` function are already defined in the scaffolding application. The ``auth`` object is highly customizable and can deal with email verification, registration approvals, CAPTCHA, and alternate login methods via plugins.
-------

#### Adding grids

We can improve this further using the ``SQLFORM.grid`` and ``SQLFORM.smartgrid`` gadgets to create a management interface for our application:

``
@auth.requires_membership(&#x27;manager&#x27;)
def manage():
    grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.image,linked_tables=[&#x27;post&#x27;])
    return dict(grid=grid)
``:code

with associated &quot;views/default/manage.html&quot;

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;Management Interface&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``

Using appadmin create a group &quot;manager&quot; and make some users members of the group. They will not be able to access

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/manage
``

and browse, search:

[[image @///image/en3200.png center 480px]]

create, update and delete images and their comments:

[[image @///image/en3300.png center 480px]]

#### Configuring the layout

You can configure the default layout by editing &quot;views/layout.html&quot; but you can also configure it without editing the HTML. In fact, the &quot;static/base.css&quot; stylesheet is well documented and described in Chapter 5. You can change color, columns, size, borders and background without editing the HTML. If you want to edit the menu, the title or the subtitle, you can do so in any model file. The scaffolding app, sets default values of these parameters in the file &quot;models/menu.py&quot;:

``
response.meta.keywords = &#x27;bla bla bla&#x27;
response.menu = [ [ &#x27;Index&#x27;, False, URL(&#x27;index&#x27;) ] ]
``:code

### A simple wiki
``wiki``:inxx ``RSS``:inxx ``Ajax``:inxx ``XMLRPC``:inxx

In this section, we build a simple wiki from scratch using only low level APIs (as opposed to using the built-in wiki capabilities of web2py demonstrated in the next section). The visitor will be able to create pages, search them (by title), and edit them. The visitor will also be able to post comments (exactly as in the previous applications), and also post documents (as attachments to the pages) and link them from the pages. As a convention, we adopt the Markmin syntax for our wiki syntax. We will also implement a search page with Ajax, an RSS feed for the pages, and a handler to search the pages via XML-RPC``xmlrpc``:cite . The following diagram lists the actions that we need to implement and the links we intend to build among them.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en3400.png center 200px]]

Start by creating a new scaffolding app, naming it &quot;mywiki&quot;.

The model must contain three tables: page, comment, and document. Both comment and document reference page because they belong to page. A document contains a file field of type upload as in the previous images application.

Here is the complete model:
``
db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)

from gluon.tools import *
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
crud = Crud(db)

db.define_table(&#x27;page&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;title&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;post&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;page_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference page&#x27;),

    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(name)s&#x27;)

db.page.title.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, &#x27;page.title&#x27;)
db.page.body.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()

db.document.created_on.readable = db.document.created_on.writable = False
``:code

Edit the controller &quot;default.py&quot; and create the following actions:
- index: list all wiki pages
- create: post another wiki page
- show: show a wiki page and its comments, and append comments
- edit: edit an existing page
- documents: manage the documents attached to a page
- download: download a document (as in the images example)
- search: display a search box and, via an Ajax callback, return all matching titles as the visitor types
- callback: the Ajax callback function. It returns the HTML that gets embedded in the search page while the visitor types.

     db.document.page_id.default = page.id
     db.document.page_id.writable = False
     grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.document.page_id==page.id,args=[page.id])
     return dict(page=page, grid=grid)

def user():
     return dict(form=auth())

def download():

     return response.download(request, db)

def search():

     return dict(form=FORM(INPUT(_id=&#x27;keyword&#x27;,_name=&#x27;keyword&#x27;,
              _onkeyup=&quot;ajax(&#x27;callback&#x27;, [&#x27;keyword&#x27;], &#x27;target&#x27;);&quot;)),
Here is the code for the view &quot;default/create.html&quot;:

If you visit the **create** page, you see the following:

[[image @///image/en3500.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/index.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Available wiki pages&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;search&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;search&#x27;))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;{{for page in pages:}}
     {{=LI(A(page.title, _href=URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=page.id)))}}
{{pass}}&lt;/ul&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;create page&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;create&#x27;))}} ]
``:code

It generates the following page:

[[image @///image/en3600.png center 480px]]

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;:

``markdown``:inxx ``MARKMIN``:inxx
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;{{=page.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;edit&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;edit&#x27;, args=request.args))}}
| {{=A(&#x27;documents&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;documents&#x27;, args=request.args))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
{{for post in comments:}}
  &lt;p&gt;{{=db.auth_user[post.created_by].first_name}} on {{=post.created_on}}
     says &lt;i&gt;{{=post.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

If you wish to use markdown syntax instead of markmin syntax:

``
from gluon.contrib.markdown import WIKI
``:code

and use ``WIKI`` instead of the ``MARKMIN`` helper.
Alternatively, you can choose to accept raw HTML instead of markmin syntax. In this case you would replace:
``
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
``:code

with:
``
{{=XML(page.body)}}
``:code

``sanitize``:inxx
(so that the XML does not get escaped, as by default web2py behavior).

This can be done better with:
``
{{=XML(page.body, sanitize=True)}}
``:code

If you fix the divide-by-zero bug in the index action and introduce one in the i
{{1/0}}
{{=LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&quot;show&quot;, args=image.id)))}}
{{pass}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en5000.png center 480px]]

Note that web2py has converted the view from HTML into a Python file, and the error described in the ticket refers to the generated Python code and NOT to the original view file:

[[image @///image/en5100.png center 480px]]

This may seem confusing at first, but in practice it makes debugging easier, because the Python indentation highlights the logical structure of the code that you embedded in the views.

The code is shown at the bottom of the same page.

All tickets are listed under admin in the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page for each application:

[[image @///image/en5200.png center 480px]]

#### Mercurial
``Mercurial``:inxx

If you are running from source and you have the Mercurial version control libraries installed:
``
easy_install mercurial
``:code

then the administrative interface shows one more menu item called &quot;Versioning&quot;. It automatically creates a local Mercurial repository for the application. Pressing the &quot;comment&quot; button in the page will commit the current application. Mercurial creates and stores information about changes you make in your code into a hidden folder &quot;.hg&quot; in your app subfolder. Every app has its own &quot;.hg&quot; folder and its own &quot;.hgignore&quot; file (tells Mercurial which files to ignore).

The Mercurial web interface does allow you to browse previous commit and diff files but we do recommend you use Mercurial directly from the shell or one of the many GUI-based Mercurial clients since they are more powerful. For example they will allow you sync your app with a remote source repository:

[[images @///image/en5300.png center 480px]]


You can read more about Mercurial here:
``
http://mercurial.selenic.com/
``

#### Application Wizard (experimental)

The **admin** interface includes a Wizard that can help you create a new applications.
You can access the wizard from the &quot;sites&quot; page as shown in the image below.

[[image @///image/en5400.png center 480px]]

The wizard will guide you through a series of steps involved in creating a new application:

- Chose a name for the application
- Configure the application and choose required plugins
- Build required models (it will create CRUD pages for each model)
- Allow you to edit the views of those pages using MARKMIN syntax

The image below shows the second step of the process.

[[image @///image/en5500.png center 480px]]

You can see a dropdown to select a layout plugin (from ``web2py.com/layouts``), a multiple choice dropdown to check other plugins (from ``web2py.com/plugins``) and a &quot;login config&quot; field where to put the Janrain &quot;domain:key&quot;.
In multi user mode, you can register students using the &quot;bulk register&quot; link in

Mind that this mechanism still assumes all users are trusted. All the apps created under admin run under the same credentials on the same filesystem. It is possible for an app created by a student to access the data and the source of an app created by another student. It is also possible for a student to create an app that locks the server.

#### Mobile **admin**

Notice that the admin application includes &quot;plugin_jqmodile&quot; which packages jQuery Mobile. When admin is accessed from a mobile devide, this is detected by web2py and the interface is displayed using a mobile friendly layout.

### More on **appadmin**

``appadmin``:inxx

**appadmin** is not intended to be exposed to the public. It is designed to help you by providing an easy access to the database. It consists of only two files: a controller &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and a view &quot;appadmin.html&quot; which are used by all actions in the controller.

The **appadmin** controller is relatively small and readable; it provides an example of designing a database interface.

**appadmin** shows which databases are available and which tables exist in each database. You can insert records and list all records for each table individually. **appadmin** paginates output 100 records at a time.

Once a set of records is selected, the header of the pages changes, allowing you to update or delete the selected records.

To update the records, enter an SQL assignment in the Query string field:
``
title = &#x27;test&#x27;
``:code

where string values must be enclosed in single quotes. Multiple fields can be separated by commas.

To delete a record, click the corresponding checkbox to confirm that you are sure.

**appadmin** can also perform joins if the SQL FILTER contains a SQL condition that involves two or more tables. For example, try:
``
db.image.id == db.post.image_id
``:code
</pre></div>
    <div class="span6"><pre style="background-color: #F2DEDE;">Here, as another example, we wish to create a web application that allows the administrator to post images and give them a name, and allows the visitors of the web site to view the named images and submit comments.

As before, from the **site** page in **admin**, create a new application called ``images``, and navigate to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page:

[[image @///image/en1900.png center 480px]]

We start by creating a model, a representation of the persistent data in the application (the images to upload, their names, and the comments). First, you need to create/edit a model file which, for lack of imagination, we call &quot;db.py&quot;. We assume the code below will replace any existing code in &quot;db.py&quot;. Models and controllers must have a ``.py`` extension since they are Python code. If the extension is not provided, it is appended by web2py. Views instead have a ``.html`` extension since they mainly contain HTML code.

Edit the &quot;db.py&quot; file by clicking the corresponding &quot;edit&quot; button:

[[image @///image/en2000.png center 480px]]

and enter the following:

``IS_EMAIL``:inxx ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx ``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
``
db = DAL(&quot;sqlite://storage.sqlite&quot;)

db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True),
   Field(&#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;upload&#x27;),
   format = &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

db.define_table(&#x27;comment&#x27;,
   Field(&#x27;image_id&#x27;, &#x27;reference image&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;author&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;email&#x27;),
   Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;))

db.image.title.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)
db.comment.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
db.comment.author.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()
db.comment.email.requires = IS_EMAIL()
db.comment.body.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()

db.comment.image_id.writable = db.comment.image_id.readable = False
``:code

Let&#x27;s analyze this line by line.

Line 1 defines a global variable called ``db`` that represents the database connection. In this case it is a connection to a SQLite database stored in the file  &quot;applications/images/databases/storage.sqlite&quot;. In the SQLite case, if the database does not exist, it is created. You can change the name of the file, as well as the name of the global variable ``db``, but it is convenient to give them the same name, to make it easy to remember.

Lines 3-5 define a table &quot;image&quot;. ``define_table`` is a method of the ``db`` object. The first argument, &quot;image&quot;, is the name of the table we are defining. The other arguments are the fields belonging to that table. This table has a field called &quot;title&quot;, a field called &quot;file&quot;, and a field called &quot;id&quot; that serves as the table primary key (&quot;id&quot; is not explicitly declared because all tables have an id field by default). The field &quot;title&quot; is a string, and the field &quot;file&quot; is of type &quot;upload&quot;. &quot;upload&quot; is a special type of field used by the web2py Data Abstraction Layer (DAL) to store the names of uploaded files. web2py knows how to upload files (via streaming if they are large), rename them safely, and store them.

When a table is defined, web2py takes one of several possible actions:
- if the table does not exist, the table is created;
- if the table exists and does not correspond to the definition, the table is altered accordingly, and if a field has a different type, web2py tries to convert its contents;
- if the table exists and corresponds to the definition, web2py does nothing.

This behavior is called &quot;migration&quot;. In web2py migrations are automatic, but can be disabled for each table by passing ``migrate=False`` as the last argument of ``define_table``.

Line 6 defines a format string for the table. It determines how a record should be represented as a string. Notice that the ``format`` argument can also be a function that takes a record and returns a string. For example:

``
format=lambda row: row.title
``:code

Lines 8-12 define another table called &quot;comment&quot;.
A comment has an &quot;author&quot;, an &quot;email&quot; (we intend to store the email address of the author of the comment), a &quot;body&quot; of type &quot;text&quot; (we intend to use it to store the actual comment posted by the author), and an &quot;image_id&quot; field of type reference that points to ``db.image`` via the &quot;id&quot; field.

In line 14, ``db.image.title`` represents the field &quot;title&quot; of table &quot;image&quot;. The attribute ``requires`` allows you to set requirements/constraints that will be enforced by web2py forms. Here we require that the &quot;title&quot; is unique:

``IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, db.image.title)``:code

&#x27;&#x27;Notice this is optional because it is set automatically given that ``Field(&#x27;title&#x27;, unique=True)``&#x27;&#x27;.

The objects representing these constraints are called validators. Multiple validators can be grouped in a list. Validators are executed in the order they appear.
``IS_NOT_IN_DB(a, b)`` is a special validator that checks that the value of a field ``b`` for a new record is not already in ``a``.

Line 15 requires that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;comment&quot; is in ``db.image.id``. As far as the database is concerned, we had already declared this  when we defined the table &quot;comment&quot;.
Now we are explicitly telling the model that this condition should be enforced by web2py, too, at the form processing level when a new comment is posted, so that invalid values do not propagate from input forms to the database. We also require that the &quot;image_id&quot; be represented by the &quot;title&quot;, ``&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;``, of the corresponding record.

Line 20 indicates that the field &quot;image_id&quot; of table &quot;comment&quot; should not be shown in forms, ``writable=False`` and not even in readonly forms, ``readable=False``.

The meaning of the validators in lines 15-17 should be obvious.

``format``:inxx
Notice that the validator
``
db.comment.image_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.image.id, &#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

can be omitted (and would be automatic) if we specify a format for referenced table:
``
db.define_table(&#x27;image&#x27;, ..., format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)
``:code

where the format can be a string or a function that takes a record and returns a string.

``appadmin``:inxx
Once a model is defined, if there are no errors, web2py creates an application administration interface to manage the database. You access it via the &quot;database administration&quot; link in the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page or directly:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/appadmin
``:code

Here is a screenshot of the **appadmin** interface:

[[image @///image/en2100.png center 480px]]

This interface is coded in the controller called &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and the corresponding view &quot;appadmin.html&quot;. From now on, we will refer to this interface simply as **appadmin**. It allows the administrator to insert new database records, edit and delete existing records, browse tables, and perform database joins.

The first time **appadmin** is accessed, the model is executed and the tables are created. The web2py DAL translates Python code into SQL statements that are specific to the selected database back-end (SQLite in this example). You can see the generated SQL from the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page by clicking on the &quot;sql.log&quot; link under &quot;models&quot;. Notice that the link is not present until the tables have been created.

[[image @///image/en2200.png center 480px]]

If you were to edit the model and access **appadmin** again, web2py would generate SQL to alter the existing tables. The generated SQL is logged into &quot;sql.log&quot;.

Now go back to **appadmin** and try to insert a new image record:

[[image @///image/en2300.png center 480px]]
is rendered as:

A handful of helpers (``INPUT``, ``TEXTAREA``, ``OPTION`` and ``SELECT``) also support some special named attributes not starting with underscore (``value``, and ``requires``). They are important for building custom forms and will be discussed later.

Go back to the &#x27;&#x27;edit&#x27;&#x27; page. It now indicates that &quot;default.py exposes index&quot;. By clicking on &quot;index&quot;, you can visit the newly created page:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/index
``:code

which looks like:

[[image @///image/en2800.png center 480px]]

If you click on the image name link, you are directed to:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/show/1
``:code

and this results in an error, since you have not yet created an action called &quot;show&quot; in controller &quot;default.py&quot;.

Let&#x27;s edit the &quot;default.py&quot; controller and replace its content with:

``SQLFORM``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx ``response.flash``:inxx ``request.args``:inxx
``response.download``:inxx
``
def index():
    images = db().select(db.image.ALL, orderby=db.image.title)
    return dict(images=images)

def show():
    image = db.image(request.args(0,cast=int)) or redirect(URL(&#x27;index&#x27;))
    db.comment.image_id.default = image.id
    form = SQLFORM(db.comment)
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = &#x27;your comment is posted&#x27;
    comments = db(db.comment.image_id==image.id).select()
    return dict(image=image, comments=comments, form=form)

def download():
    return response.download(request, db)
``:code

The controller contains two actions: &quot;show&quot; and &quot;download&quot;.
The &quot;show&quot; action selects the image with the ``id`` parsed from the request args and all comments related to the image. &quot;show&quot; then passes everything to the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

The image id referenced by:
``
URL(&#x27;show&#x27;, args=image.id)
``:code

in &quot;default/index.html&quot;, can be accessed as:

``request.args(0,cast=int)``

from the &quot;show&quot; action. The ``cast=int`` argument is optional but very important. It attempts to cast the string value passed in the PATH_INFO into an int. On failure it raise a proper exception instead of causing a ticket. One can also specify a redirect in case of failure to cast:

``request.args(0,cast=int,otherwise=URL(&#x27;error&#x27;))``

Moreover ``db.image(...)`` is a shortcut for

``
db(db.image.id==...).select().first()
``:code

The &quot;download&quot; action expects a filename in ``request.args(0)``, builds a path to the location where that file is supposed to be, and sends it back to the client. If the file is too large, it streams the file without incurring any memory overhead.

Notice the following statements:
- Line 7 creates an insert form SQLFORM for the ``db.comment`` table using only the specified fields.
- Line 8 sets the value for the reference field, which is not part of the input form because it is not in the list of fields specified above.
- Line 9 processes the submitted form (the submitted form variables are in ``request.vars``) within the current session (the session is used to prevent double submissions, and to enforce navigation). If the submitted form variables are validated, the new comment is inserted in the ``db.comment`` table; otherwise the form is modified to include error messages (for example, if the author&#x27;s email address is invalid). This is all done in line 9!.
- Line 10 is only executed if the form is accepted, after the record is inserted into the database table. ``response.flash`` is a web2py variable that is displayed in the views and used to notify the visitor that something happened.
- Line 11 selects all comments that reference the current image.

-------
The &quot;download&quot; action is already defined in the &quot;default.py&quot; controller of the scaffolding application.
-------

The &quot;download&quot; action does not return a dictionary, so it does not need a view. The &quot;show&quot; action, though, should have a view, so return to **admin** and create a new view called &quot;default/show.html&quot;.

Edit this new file and replace its content with the following:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Image: {{=image.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot;
     src=&quot;{{=URL(&#x27;download&#x27;, args=image.file)}}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
{{if len(comments):}}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  {{for comment in comments:}}
    &lt;p&gt;{{=comment.author}} says &lt;i&gt;{{=comment.body}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  {{pass}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{else:}}
  &lt;h2&gt;No comments posted yet&lt;/h2&gt;
{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

This view displays the **image.file** by calling the &quot;download&quot; action inside an ``&lt;img ... /&gt;`` tag.
If there are comments, it loops over them and displays each one.

Here is how everything will appear to a visitor.

[[image @///image/en2900.png center 480px]]

When a visitor submits a comment via this page, the comment is stored in the database and appended at the bottom of the page.

#### Adding authentication

The web2py API for Role-Based Access Control is quite sophisticated, but for now we will limit ourselves to restricting access to the show action to authenticated users, deferring a more detailed discussion to Chapter 9.

To limit access to authenticated users, we need to complete three steps. In a model, for example &quot;db.py&quot;, we need to add:
``
from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables(username=True)
``:code

In our controller, we need to add one action:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/login

[[image @///image/en3100.png center 480px]]

The ``user`` function also exposes, among others, the following actions:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/logout
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/register
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/profile
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/change_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/request_reset_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_username
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/retrieve_password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/verify_email
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/impersonate
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/user/not_authorized
``:code

Now, a first-time user needs to register in order to be able to log in and read or post comments.

-------
Both the ``auth`` object and the ``user`` function are already defined in the scaffolding application. The ``auth`` object is highly customizable and can deal with email verification, registration approvals, CAPTCHA, and alternate login methods via plugins.
-------

#### Adding grids

We can improve this further using the ``SQLFORM.grid`` and ``SQLFORM.smartgrid`` gadgets to create a management interface for our application:

``
@auth.requires_membership(&#x27;manager&#x27;)
def manage():
    grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.image,linked_tables=[&#x27;comment&#x27;])
    return dict(grid=grid)
``:code

with associated &quot;views/default/manage.html&quot;

``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h2&gt;Management Interface&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=grid}}
``

Using appadmin create a group &quot;manager&quot; and make some users members of the group. They will not be able to access

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/default/manage
``

and browse, search:

[[image @///image/en3200.png center 480px]]

create, update and delete images and their comments:

[[image @///image/en3300.png center 480px]]

#### Configuring the layout

You can configure the default layout by editing &quot;views/layout.html&quot; but you can also configure it without editing the HTML. In fact, the &quot;static/base.css&quot; stylesheet is well documented and described in Chapter 5. You can change color, columns, size, borders and background without editing the HTML. If you want to edit the menu, the title or the subtitle, you can do so in any model file. The scaffolding app, sets default values of these parameters in the file &quot;models/menu.py&quot;:

``
response.meta.keywords = &#x27;bla bla bla&#x27;
response.menu = [ [ &#x27;Index&#x27;, False, URL(&#x27;index&#x27;) ] ]
``:code

### A simple wiki
``wiki``:inxx ``RSS``:inxx ``Ajax``:inxx ``XMLRPC``:inxx

In this section, we build a simple wiki from scratch using only low level APIs (as opposed to using the built-in wiki capabilities of web2py demonstrated in the next section). The visitor will be able to create pages, search them (by title), and edit them. The visitor will also be able to post comments (exactly as in the previous applications), and also post documents (as attachments to the pages) and link them from the pages. As a convention, we adopt the Markmin syntax for our wiki syntax. We will also implement a search page with Ajax, an RSS feed for the pages, and a handler to search the pages via XML-RPC``xmlrpc``:cite . The following diagram lists the actions that we need to implement and the links we intend to build among them.

[[yUML diagram @///image/en3400.png center 200px]]

Start by creating a new scaffolding app, naming it &quot;mywiki&quot;.

The model must contain three tables: page, comment, and document. Both comment and document reference page because they belong to page. A document contains a file field of type upload as in the previous images application.

Here is the complete model:
``
db = DAL(&#x27;sqlite://storage.sqlite&#x27;)

from gluon.tools import *
auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()
crud = Crud(db)

db.define_table(&#x27;page&#x27;,
    Field(&#x27;title&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;body&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;),
    Field(&#x27;created_on&#x27;, &#x27;datetime&#x27;, default=request.now),
    Field(&#x27;created_by&#x27;, &#x27;reference auth_user&#x27;, default=auth.user_id),
    format=&#x27;%(title)s&#x27;)

``:code

Edit the controller &quot;default.py&quot; and create the following actions:
- index: list all wiki pages
- create: post another wiki page
- show: show a wiki page and its comments, and append comments
- edit: edit an existing page
- documents: manage the documents attached to a page
- download: download a document (as in the images example)
- search: display a search box and, via an Ajax callback, return all matching titles as the visitor types
- callback: the Ajax callback function. It returns the HTML that gets embedded in the search page while the visitor types.

Here is the &quot;default.py&quot; controller:

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/create.html&quot;:

If you visit the **create** page, you see the following:

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/index.html&quot;:
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;Available wiki pages&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;search&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;search&#x27;))}} ]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;{{for page in pages:}}

{{pass}}&lt;/ul&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;create page&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;create&#x27;))}} ]
``:code

It generates the following page:

Here is the code for the view &quot;default/show.html&quot;:

``markdown``:inxx ``MARKMIN``:inxx
``
{{extend &#x27;layout.html&#x27;}}
&lt;h1&gt;{{=page.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
[ {{=A(&#x27;edit&#x27;, _href=URL(&#x27;edit&#x27;, args=request.args))}}

{{pass}}
&lt;h2&gt;Post a comment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{=form}}
``:code

If you wish to use markdown syntax instead of markmin syntax:

``
from gluon.contrib.markdown import WIKI
``:code

and use ``WIKI`` instead of the ``MARKMIN`` helper.
Alternatively, you can choose to accept raw HTML instead of markmin syntax. In this case you would replace:
``
{{=MARKMIN(page.body)}}
``:code

with:
``
{{=XML(page.body)}}
``:code

``sanitize``:inxx
(so that the XML does not get escaped, as by default web2py behavior).

This can be done better with:
``
{{=XML(page.body, sanitize=True)}}
``:code

If you fix the divide-by-zero bug in the index action and introduce one in the i
{{1/0}}
{{=LI(A(image.title, _href=URL(&quot;show&quot;, args=image.id)))}}
{{pass}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
``:code

you get the following ticket:

[[image @///image/en5000.png center 480px]]

Note that web2py has converted the view from HTML into a Python file, and the error described in the ticket refers to the generated Python code and NOT to the original view file:

[[image @///image/en5100.png center 480px]]

This may seem confusing at first, but in practice it makes debugging easier, because the Python indentation highlights the logical structure of the code that you embedded in the views.

The code is shown at the bottom of the same page.

All tickets are listed under admin in the &#x27;&#x27;errors&#x27;&#x27; page for each application:

#### Mercurial
``Mercurial``:inxx

If you are running from source and you have the Mercurial version control libraries installed:
``
easy_install mercurial
``:code

then the administrative interface shows one more menu item called &quot;Versioning&quot;. It automatically creates a local Mercurial repository for the application. Pressing the &quot;commit&quot; button in the page will commit the current application. Mercurial creates and stores information about changes you make in your code into a hidden folder &quot;.hg&quot; in your app subfolder. Every app has its own &quot;.hg&quot; folder and its own &quot;.hgignore&quot; file (tells Mercurial which files to ignore).

The Mercurial web interface does allow you to browse previous commit and diff files but we do recommend you use Mercurial directly from the shell or one of the many GUI-based Mercurial clients since they are more powerful. For example they will allow you sync your app with a remote source repository:

[[images @///image/en5300.png center 480px]]


You can read more about Mercurial here:
``
http://mercurial.selenic.com/
``

#### Application Wizard (experimental)

The **admin** interface includes a Wizard that can help you create a new applications.
You can access the wizard from the &quot;sites&quot; page as shown in the image below.

[[image @///image/en5400.png center 480px]]

The wizard will guide you through a series of steps involved in creating a new application:

- Chose a name for the application
- Configure the application and choose required plugins
- Build required models (it will create CRUD pages for each model)
- Allow you to edit the views of those pages using MARKMIN syntax

The image below shows the second step of the process.

[[image @///image/en5500.png center 480px]]

You can see a dropdown to select a layout plugin (from ``web2py.com/layouts``), a multiple choice dropdown to check other plugins (from ``web2py.com/plugins``) and a &quot;login config&quot; field where to put the Janrain &quot;domain:key&quot;.
In multi user mode, you can register students using the &quot;bulk register&quot; link in

Mind that this mechanism still assumes all users are trusted. All the apps created under admin run under the same credentials on the same filesystem. It is possible for an app created by a student to access the data and the source of an app created by another student. It is also possible for a student to create an app that locks the server.

#### Mobile **admin**

Notice that the admin application includes &quot;plugin_jqmodile&quot; which packages jQuery Mobile. When admin is accessed from a mobile devide, this is detected by web2py and the interface is displayed using a mobile friendly layout.

### More on **appadmin**

``appadmin``:inxx

**appadmin** is not intended to be exposed to the public. It is designed to help you by providing an easy access to the database. It consists of only two files: a controller &quot;appadmin.py&quot; and a view &quot;appadmin.html&quot; which are used by all actions in the controller.

The **appadmin** controller is relatively small and readable; it provides an example of designing a database interface.

**appadmin** shows which databases are available and which tables exist in each database. You can insert records and list all records for each table individually. **appadmin** paginates output 100 records at a time.

Once a set of records is selected, the header of the pages changes, allowing you to update or delete the selected records.

To update the records, enter an SQL assignment in the Query string field:
``
title = &#x27;test&#x27;
``:code

where string values must be enclosed in single quotes. Multiple fields can be separated by commas.

To delete a record, click the corresponding checkbox to confirm that you are sure.

**appadmin** can also perform joins if the SQL FILTER contains a SQL condition that involves two or more tables. For example, try:
``
db.image.id == db.comment.image_id
``:code
